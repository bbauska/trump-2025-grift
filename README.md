<p>A little background<br>
<p>Donald Trump has made tens of thousands of lies. These have cost human lives.</p>
<p>Fact-checkers at The Washington Post documented 30,573 false or misleading claims during 
his first presidential term (2016-2020), an average of 21 per day. The Toronto Star tallied 5,276 
false claims from January 2017 to June, 2019 (2 1/2 years)</p>

<p>On January 20, 2025 Trump became president a 2nd time. God save America. Grift? Yes. It 
started immediately. Over 3.5 billion tallied so far, between Jan 20, 2025 and July 1, 2025.</p>

<h2>Trump's 13 BIGGEST lies in his first month back in office</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>President Donald Trump moved at a blistering pace in his first month back in the White 
House. He lied fast and furious, too.</p>

<p>In speeches, interviews, exchanges with reporters and posts on social media, the 
president filled his public statements not only with exaggerations but outright 
fabrications. As he did during his first presidency, Trump made false claims with a 
frequency and variety unmatched by any other elected official in Washington.</p>

<p>Here is our list of Trump’s 13 biggest lies since he was inaugurated on January 20. It 
was hard to choose.</p>

<p>The tale of the $50 million – no, make it $100 million – in condoms for Hamas: When 
press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced at her first official White House briefing 
that Trump had thwarted a plan to spend $50 million “to fund condoms in Gaza,” it was 
immediately clear the claim was highly dubious; the Trump administration had no evidence 
to substantiate it. But Trump not only repeated the $50 million figure the next day, he 
added an incendiary claim that the condoms were “for Hamas.” Then, days after it had 
become obvious the $50 million figure was pure fiction, he inflated it to “$100 million.”</p>

<p>This was another example of Trumpflation – the president’s years-old habit of making his 
inaccurate stories more and more inaccurate over time.</p>

<p>Blaming Ukraine for starting the war on Ukraine: Russia started the war in Ukraine when 
it invaded Ukraine in 2022. That is an obvious fact. But on Tuesday, when Trump dismissed 
Ukrainians’ complaints about their exclusion from US-Russia negotiations about ending 
the war, he falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war – saying, “You should’ve never 
started it. You could’ve made a deal.” Laughable Kremlin-style propaganda, this time 
from the president of the United States.</p>

<p>The (non-)uniqueness of birthright citizenship: Trump offered what might have sounded 
like a reasonable rationale for his attempt to get rid of birthright citizenship. The 
United States, he said, is the only country that has birthright citizenship.</p>

<p>Except that is not true, as CNN and other outlets pointed out when Trump made the same 
claim as president in 2018 and on various other occasions. Dozens of countries, 
including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship to people born on their 
soil.</p>

<p>More up-is-down reversing of the reality of January 6: For years now, Trump has presented 
a version of the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, that bears little resemblance to what 
actually happened. When he was asked in early February why he granted pardons to people 
who assaulted first responders, he said the people he pardoned were actually “assaulted 
by our government” and that “they didn’t assault.” This “they didn’t assault” claim was 
a brazen denial of the obvious truth, clear in video after video and trial after trial. 
The Justice Department has said more than 140 officers were assaulted on January 6, and 
that more than 170 people pleaded guilty to such assaults.</p>

<p>A gusher of deceit about California water policy: Amid disaster, more dishonesty. First, 
Trump linked the Los Angeles wildfires to California’s decision to use some of its water 
to protect a fish species in the northern part of the state – even though the two things 
have nothing to do with each other, as befuddled experts explained to anyone who would 
listen.</p>

<p>Then, after ordering the sudden release of billions of gallons of water from Central 
Valley reservoirs for no apparent good reason, Trump declared that some of this water 
was heading to Los Angeles – even though it wasn’t heading to Los Angeles and couldn’t 
go to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The election lie he refused to let die: What can you even say about this one at this 
point? Trump’s win in the free and fair 2024 election did not convince him to abandon 
his endless lying about his defeat in the free and fair 2020 election. More than four 
years after his loss to Joe Biden, he repeated his “rigged” nonsense during at least 
three events on his 2025 inauguration day alone, then a bunch of times after that.</p>

<p>That fable about Olympic boxers, again: Trump, once a prominent promoter of lies about 
President Barack Obama’s birthplace, continued to demonstrate no hesitation lying about 
not only policy issues but also individual people. This time, to promote his push to 
try to get transgender athletes banned from the Olympics, he told his familiar story 
about how two gold medalists in women’s boxing at the Games in Paris last year were 
men who “transitioned.”</p>

<p>Wrong. As the International Olympic Committee repeatedly noted during the Olympics, 
when Trump and others made such claims, neither champion had transitioned; both were 
born as female and have always competed in women’s events. Even the discredited boxing 
authority that controversially disqualified the women from a 2023 competition, vaguely 
claiming a test had found they had unfair competitive advantages, did not allege they 
had transitioned.</p>

<p>The president’s fictionalized northern neighbor: Before taking office, Trump casually 
asserted that the Canadian people “like” his idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state. 
That was the opposite of the truth; the idea is hugely unpopular with the Canadian 
public. Then, after his inauguration, Trump continued to make stuff up about Canada – 
at one point posting on social media and then saying out loud that Canada prohibits US 
banks from doing business there. He added, “Can you believe that?” No doubt some 
Americans believe it, but it’s false.</p>

<p>Blasting Biden for a program launched under Trump: After the deadly January collision 
between a military helicopter and a passenger jet, Trump blamed Biden administration 
diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration without providing any 
evidence any FAA diversity policy had anything to do with the crash. He added in a 
fictional story about a frantic last-minute Biden push to hire people with significant 
disabilities as air traffic controllers, failing to explain that this FAA pilot program 
was actually a years-old initiative launched during his own administration in 2019.</p>

<p>Relentless deception about who pays tariffs: When Trump talked about the tariffs he 
imposed on Chinese imports in his first presidency, he spoke of how much money “from 
China” these tariffs generated for the US Treasury. When he talked about the additional 
tariffs he plans to impose on various other countries during his current presidency, he 
spoke of a need to “charge them.” At no point did he acknowledge that US importers, not 
foreign countries, are the ones who pay the actual tariff charges – or that study after 
study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan trade commission, found 
that Americans ended up bearing almost the entire cost of his first-term tariffs on 
Chinese products.</p>

<p>A wild exaggeration of the increase in autism rates: Trump keeps flirting with, though 
not explicitly endorsing, the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory that childhood 
vaccines cause autism – and in a social media post in early February, he inflated the 
extent of the increase in the known prevalence of autism over the last two decades. 
“20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT’S 1 in 34,” Trump wrote. 
“WOW! Something’s really wrong.” Aside from the fact that experts say the increase in 
autism diagnoses (to 1 in 36 children by age 8 in 2020) likely has to do with greater 
awareness of the symptoms and improved screening practices, public statistics from the 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the known prevalence in 2004 
was 1 in 125 children, not “1 in 10,000.” That’s a pretty big difference.</p>

<p>China’s (non-)operation of the Panama Canal: Much of Trump’s lying is ad-libbed. Some of 
it, however, is planned in advance. Some of it, however, is written into his prepared 
speeches. He said in his inaugural address in January: “Above all, China is operating 
the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re 
taking it back.”</p>

<p>This would have been a good line if China was actually operating the Panama Canal. It 
isn’t; Panama is, though Trump could have raised legitimate questions about China’s 
influence in the area.</p>

<p>Trump’s invented dominance with “the youth vote”: Trump said some accurate things 
while touting his victory in the 2024 election, such as the fact that he swept all 
seven swing states. But in keeping with his longstanding practice of exaggerating 
even legitimate accomplishments, he also kept sprinkling in a claim that wasn’t 
even close to correct – an assertion that he won the youth vote “by 36 points.” 
In fact, exit polls show he lost the youth vote to then-Vice President Kamala 
Harris. Even if these polls were off, there’s no basis for the claim that he won the 
youth vote by 36.</p>

<h2>Trump's 100 BIGGEST lies in his first 100 days in office</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>President Donald Trump filled his first 100 days back in office with the same relentless 
lying and inaccuracy that was a hallmark of his first presidency and his 2016 and 2024 
presidential campaigns.</p>

<p>Some of Trump’s 2025 false claims were about consequential policy matters, others about 
trivial personal fixations. Some were sophisticated distortions about obscure subjects, 
others obvious fictions about issues average Americans experience in their daily lives. 
Many were ad-libbed or posted on social media, but many were scripted into prepared remarks.</p>

<p>Aside from the staggering frequency and the trademark brazenness, what stood out was how 
repetitive Trump’s lying was. Though he regularly sprinkled in some fresh deception, he 
deployed a core batch of favored falsehoods again and again – undeterred by the fact 
that many of these claims had been publicly debunked for months or even years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-debunked">
Here is a list of 100 separate false claims</a> from Trump since his inauguration on January 
20, fact-checked concisely with hyperlinks to more information. This is not a 
comprehensive list of the president’s false claims during this period (there were well 
over 100 in all) or a count of how many total times he was inaccurate (he uttered many 
of these 100 claims over and over again).

did not complete the wall</a>. The 458 miles of construction fell far short of the 1,000 miles he campaigned on building, and when he left office, there were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html">

was April 2020</a>, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his term and when global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
President Donald Trump again turned a Cabinet meeting into a wide-ranging conversation 
with reporters – and again uttered a whole bunch of false claims in the process.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Trump’s Tuesday remarks at the White House included inaccurate assertions about 
inflation, immigration, his tariff policy, the massive domestic policy bill he signed 
last week, China’s use of wind energy, US and European aid to Ukraine, the US 
relationship with South Korea, and other subjects.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Here is a fact check of 11 of the president’s false claims. This is not a comprehensive 
list.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>The economy, tariffs, taxes</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Inflation: As he has repeatedly, Trump falsely claimed Tuesday, “We have no inflation.” 
The US does have inflation – an annual inflation rate of 2.4% in May, an uptick from a 
2.3% annual rate in April. That April rate was the lowest since early 2021, and lower 
than some economists expected for April after Trump imposed significant new tariffs, 
but it’s not “no inflation” whatsoever. (And on a month-to-month basis, US consumer 
prices increased 0.1% in May and 0.2% in April.)

Tax on Social Security: Touting the new domestic policy legislation, Trump repeated his 
false claim that it achieves his campaign promise of “no tax on Social Security.” It 
does not.

The legislation does create an additional, temporary $6,000-per-year tax deduction for 
individuals age 65 and older (with a smaller deduction for individuals earning $75,000 
per year or more), but the White House itself has implicitly acknowledged that millions 
of Social Security recipients age 65 and older will continue to pay taxes on their 
benefits – and that new deduction, which expires in 2028, doesn’t even apply to the 
Social Security recipients who are younger than 65.

Trump’s tariff letters: Trump spoke of the letters he sent to various foreign leaders 
announcing the tariff rates he plans to impose on their countries beginning in August 
– and said, “I just want you to know - a letter means a deal.” That’s just not true. 
Multiple letters the White House revealed on Monday announced tariff rates Trump said 
he plans to unilaterally place on imports from foreign countries; those letters did 
not describe negotiated deals.

Who pays tariffs: Trump repeatedly spoke of how his new tariffs mean other countries 
will have to “pay” the US for the privilege of doing business in the US. Contrary to 
Trump’s frequent assertions, it is the US importers who buy foreign products, not 
foreign countries themselves, who make the tariff payments to the US government.

Tariff history: Trump repeated his regular false claim that the US was “proportionately” 
at its “wealthiest” between 1870 and 1913, when tariff revenue made up a much larger 
share of federal revenue before the reintroduction of the income tax. Trump didn’t 
explain what he meant by “proportionately” or “the wealthiest,” but economists say that 
by any standard measure, the US is far wealthier today than it was in the early 20th 
century and prior; per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it 
was then.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>Environment and energy</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
China and wind power: Trump, asserting that “smart countries” don’t use wind and solar 
energy, repeated his recent false claim that China, the world’s biggest manufacturer 
of wind turbines, barely uses such equipment itself - wrongly saying, “They don’t have 
a lot of wind farms, I’ll tell you; very, very few.” In reality, China is the world 
leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore; 
it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US.

California and energy: Trump, reviving a previous inaccurate complaint about 
California’s use of renewable energy sources, falsely claimed: “They have blackouts 
and brownouts every week.” The state simply does not; its power system has improved 
significantly since the rolling blackouts of a 2020 heat wave.

Daniel Villasenor, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said in a Tuesday email that 
Trump is again “lying about California.” Villasenor wrote: “The state has not experienced 
any rotating outages since 2020 – and in the last three years, no Flex Alert calling to 
conserve power has even been issued. Not only has our grid been increasingly resilient, 
it’s also cleaner than ever – clean energy provided for 100% of demand on our grid for 
at least some part of the day 167 out of the first 180 days of the year.”

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>Foreign affairs</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
US and European aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that the US has 
provided “far more” wartime aid to Ukraine that Europe has, saying the US is “in there 
for over $300 billion; Europe’s in there for over $100 billion.”

Those numbers are not close to accurate.

According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely 
tracks international aid to Ukraine, the US had committed about $139 billion in military, 
financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine from late January 2022, just prior to Russia’s 
full-scale invasion, through April 2025 – well short of about $298 billion committed by 
European countries and the European Union. The gap was much narrower in terms of aid 
actually allocated through April 2025 – about $183 billion for Europe to about $134 
billion for the US – but even those figures clearly disprove Trump’s claim.

South Korea’s military cost-sharing: Trump repeated his false claim that South Korea 
convinced former President Joe Biden to let it stop making payments to help cover the 
cost of the US military presence in South Korea, saying Biden “cut it down to nothing.” 
In fact, Biden’s administration signed two cost-sharing agreements with South Korea, 
one in 2021 and one in 2024, that included South Korean spending increases – meaning 
South Korea agreed to pay more than it did during Trump’s first term.

US troops in South Korea: Trump again exaggerated the US troop presence in South Korea, 
falsely saying, “You know, we have 45,000 soldiers in South Korea.” Official Defense 
Department data, published online, says the US had 26,206 military personnel in South 
Korea as of March 31, 2025, with 22,844 on active duty.

<h3>Immigration</h3>
Migration and mental health: Trump falsely claimed that unnamed foreign countries 
“released their insane asylum – the insane asylum population into our country.” Even 
Trump’s own presidential campaign could not produce any evidence for his frequent 
claims, which he has repeated for more than two years, that foreign countries 
deliberately emptied their mental health facilities to somehow get patients to 
migrate to the United States.

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, 
Corruptions, and Crimes Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began

this list a collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it 
felt urgent to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be 
forgotten. Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, 
economic, and constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this 
new round of horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of

JUNE 2025
 – June 1, 2025 – The Trump administration
abandoned Biden-era regulations for slashing credit card late fees. The purported savings 
were posted on an “Agency Deregulation Leaderboard.” The leaderboard claimed the Trump 
administration saved Americans $29.4 billion as a result of reversing regulations in 
health insurance, bank fees, and appliance efficiency standards. According to experts 
and government analyses, the leaderboard’s findings are not reliable. Steve Cicala, 
codirector of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Project on the Economic 
Analysis of Regulation, said, “This is just taking money from households and transferring 
it to banks and credit card companies, and to water and power utility companies.”

– June 2, 2025 – President Trump announced his goal to double the amount of oil coming 
through Alaska’s oil pipeline system. His plans would repeal Biden-era restrictions 
banning drilling and mining in millions of acres of pristine Alaskan wilderness. The 
announcement highlighted a trip to Prudhoe Bay by US Energy Secretary Chris Wright. 
In a post to X, Wright said, “Unleashing American energy goes hand in hand with 
unleashing American prosperity.” In response, Kristen Miller, executive director of 
the Alaska Wilderness League, said, “This is another attempt to sell off public lands 
to oil industry billionaires at the expense of one of the wildest places left in America.”

– June 2, 2025 – David Richardson, the acting head of FEMA, told employees that he did 
not know the United States had a hurricane season. “Yesterday, as everybody knows, was 
the first day of hurricane season,” he said. “I didn’t realize it was a season.” FEMA 
staff were unclear if Richardson was serious or making a joke. The DHS, which oversees 
FEMA, stated in a press release that Mr. Richardson was joking. Before heading FEMA, 
Richardson worked in the DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

– June 3, 2025 – Former DOGE director Elon Musk blasted President Trump’s “Big Beautiful 
Bill” of tax cuts and spending plans just days after departing the administration. Musk 
posted on X, “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a 
disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it.” Axios reported that Musk’s 
criticisms stemmed from the bill’s cutting of the electric vehicle tax credit, the 
Federal Aviation Administration’s refusal to use his Starlink satellite system for 
national air traffic control, and Trump’s withdrawal of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to 
be NASA administrator. The Axios source claimed that Elon was “butthurt.”

– June 5, 2025 – Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s relationship deteriorated as the former 
allies hurled personal insults at each other through social media. Their feud began 
after Musk criticized Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill," calling it “a disgusting 
abomination.” Trump responded, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions 
and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.” 
On X, Musk mocked Trump’s connections to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein: 
“Time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the 
real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Trump then referenced 
Musk’s recent Oval Office farewell, where he sported a black eye. Trump retorted, “You 
saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval desk. Even with a black eye. 
I said, Do you want a little makeup?” Musk admitted that the shiner came from his 
five-year-old son, X. “I was just horsing around with little X, and I said, ‘Go ahead, 
punch me in the face,’ and he did.”

– June 6, 2025 – Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador during 
ICE’s initial crackdown, was returned to the United States to face criminal charges. In 
a press briefing, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said that a federal grand jury had 
indicted Ábrego García on counts of illegally smuggling undocumented people as well as 
of conspiracy to commit that crime. “He was a smuggler of humans and children and 
women,” she claimed. “This is what American justice looks like.” Ábrego García’s lawyer, 
Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said, “After months of delay and secrecy, they’re bringing 
him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.”

– June 6, 2025 – A large crowd of demonstrators in Los Angeles gathered in the downtown 
Fashion District after ICE agents showed up at an apparel manufacturing business. By 
the end of the day, forty people had been taken by ICE and hundreds of protesters 
clashed with police at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. In response to the raids, 
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X, “As Mayor of a proud city of 
immigrants, I am deeply angered by what has taken place. These tactics sow terror in 
our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety. We will not stand for this.” 
The next morning, FBI Director Kash Patel responded to Bass, saying, “We will.”

– June 7, 2025 – A White House memorandum issued by Donald Trump for the secretary of 
defense, the attorney general, and the secretary of homeland security:

“Numerous incidents of violence and disorder have recently occurred and threaten to 
continue in response to the enforcement of Federal law by the US Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other United States Government personnel who are 
performing Federal functions and supporting the faithful execution of Federal 
immigration laws… To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit 
the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority 
of the Government of the United States. In light of these incidents and credible 
threats of continued violence, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby call into 
Federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 U.S.C.12406 to 
temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are 
performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to 
protect Federal property.”

– June 8, 2025 – Following orders from the president and bypassing consent from 
California Governor Gavin Newsom, approximately three hundred National Guard troops 
began arriving in Los Angeles. The National Guard is often deployed to respond to 
natural disasters and is typically only federalized when a governor makes a request. 
The last time a state’s National Guard was deployed without a governor’s consent was 
in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the National Guard to protect civil 
rights activists marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. In a joint statement, 
twenty-two Democratic governors called Trump’s decision “an alarming abuse of power.” 
Characterizing the deployment as “unlawful” and “a serious breach of state sovereignty,” 
Governor Newsom formally requested that the Trump administration rescind its deployment 
of Guard troops.

– June 9, 2025 – The US military confirmed that seven hundred Marines were being deployed 
to Los Angeles, and the Department of Defense announced it was deploying an additional 
two thousand National Guard troops. Meanwhile, California sued the Trump administration 
over the deployment of the National Guard, arguing that Trump had “unlawfully bypassed” 
California Governor Gavin Newsom by federalizing the National Guard troops without the 
governor’s permission. “One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that 
our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit stated. “The Founders 
enshrined these principles in our Constitution—that a government should be accountable 
to its people, guided by the rule of law, and one of civil authority, not military rule.”

– June 9, 2025 – Trump accused the protesters in Los Angeles of being “insurrectionists” 
and suggested that California Governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested. “The people who 
are causing the problems are bad people. They are insurrectionists,” said Trump, 
repeating a term that some of his aides have used. Pushing back against Trump’s 
description of the protest, California officials have stated that the protests were 
confined to a relatively small area and were predominantly peaceful. When asked whether 
he supported statements from his border czar, Tom Homan, about arresting state officials 
who obstruct federal immigration raids, Trump responded, “I’d do it if I were Tom. I 
think it’s great. Gavin likes the publicity.” Asked about Homan’s comments on MSNBC, 
Newsom responded, “He’s a tough guy. Why doesn’t he do that? He knows where to find 
me. That kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let’s go.”

– June 9, 2025 – Reneging on a promise made during his confirmation hearings, Health and 
Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, fired all 
seventeen members of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization. The Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices votes on which populations should receive vaccinations and 
when they should be administered; insurance companies and Medicaid are required to cover 
the recommended vaccines. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kennedy Jr. incorrectly 
claimed that most members of the committee—who are screened for conflicts of interest 
and forbidden from holding stocks or serving on boards of vaccine manufacturers—had 
received funding from Big Pharma and characterized the firings as “a bold step in 
restoring public trust.” Experts quickly fired back. “Secretary Kennedy has not hidden 
his anti-vaccine agenda. He, more than anyone in our country, has worked to undermine 
people’s trust and confidence in vaccines,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting 
CDC director.

– June 9, 2025 – Reviving a controversial measure from his first term, President Trump’s 
new travel ban against predominantly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect. 
The ban barred individuals from the following twelve countries from entering the US: 
Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, 
Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. A partial ban, including heightened restrictions, 
was also applied to individuals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, 
Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has 
underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals 
who are not properly vetted,” Trump said in a video, referring to a firebombing attack 
by a man who is from Egypt, which is not impacted by the travel ban. Amnesty 
International called the travel ban “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.” 
Trump’s first travel ban faced significant legal challenges, and former President 
Joe Biden called it a “stain on our national conscience.”

– June 10, 2025 – During a speech at Fort Bragg, President Trump announced that he would 
restore the original Confederate names of seven Army bases. Skirting a law that prevents 
the Pentagon from naming bases after Confederate leaders or battles, Trump said the bases 
instead honored soldiers who happened to share the same names as the Confederates. A 
similar move occurred in February when the Army renamed Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg, its 
original name, but claimed the base now honored Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran, 
rather than the Confederate general Braxton Bragg. “The bottom line is [Trump]’s 
choosing surname over service,” said Ty Seidule, a retired Army brigadier general. 
“It’s breaking the spirit of a law that was created by the will of the American people 
through their elected representatives.”

– June 10, 2025 – In an interview with Bloomberg News, US Ambassador to Israel Mike 
Huckabee said that the US would no longer work toward the formation of an independent 
Palestinian state, marking a major shift in foreign policy. When asked if a Palestinian 
state remained a US policy goal, Huckabee said, “I don’t think so,” adding that the 
territory for any future Palestinian state would need to be carved out from “a Muslim 
country” rather than Israel. Responding to a question about Palestinian statehood 
aspirations in the West Bank, Huckabee used biblical terminology, “Does it have to be 
in Judea and Samaria?” In a separate BBC interview, Huckabee expanded on his views: 
“Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel. So 
maybe, if there is such a desire for a Palestinian state, there would be someone who 
would say, we’d like to host it.” During his 2008 presidential run, Huckabee said, 
“There is no such thing as a Palestinian.”

– June 10, 2025 – Following another day of protests in Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass 
announced a curfew, and Governor Gavin Newsom made a nationally televised address. 
“Donald Trump, without consulting California law enforcement leaders, commandeered two 
thousand of our state’s National Guard members to deploy on our streets, illegally and 
for no reason. This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible 
situation, putting our people, our officers, and even our National Guard at risk,” said 
Newsom, who accused Trump of “fanning the flames.” “Democracy is under assault right 
before our eyes,” Newsom continued. “The rule of law has increasingly been given away 
to the rule of Don.” On the same day, ABC News reported that there were more US troops 
deployed to Los Angeles than to Iraq and Syria, while Poynter reported that journalists 
were injured—and possibly targeted—while covering the protests.

– June 11, 2025 – The Trump administration announced it would eliminate Biden-era 
regulations on power plants, the second largest source of pollution, and weaken 
restrictions on other hazardous emissions that could threaten public health. “EPA 
is helping pave the way for American energy dominance, because energy development 
underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security,” said 
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who also called efforts to rein in climate change a 
“cult.” “The key rationale Zeldin is using to justify the dismantling of our nation’s 
protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible,” said 
former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. “By giving a green light to more pollution, 
his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry 
at the expense of our health.”

– June 11, 2025 – During the Los Angeles protests, a video captured federal agents in 
two unmarked vehicles colliding directly into another car and trapping it between them to 
arrest the driver. Besides the driver, a woman and a child were in the car when it was 
hit. According to witnesses, the agents dispersed a “chemical-smelling smoke” near the 
pinned car while the woman and child were still inside. “There were kids involved inside 
that car, and it is scary to think about,” said John Lopez, who witnessed the collision 
and arrest. Although LAPD initially said the incident was being investigated as a 
possible assault or hit and run, DHS pushed back against that characterization on 
social media: “This was no hit and run. This was a targeted arrest of a violent rioter.” 
On the same day, another video showed law enforcement shooting a woman at close range 
with what appeared to be “less lethal” ammunition while she was walking to her apartment.

– June 12, 2025 – After attempting to ask a question during DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s 
press conference in Los Angeles, California Senator Alex Padilla, the son of Mexican 
immigrants, was forcibly removed from the room, pushed to the floor, and handcuffed by 
Secret Service and FBI agents. In a viral video of the incident, Padilla can be heard 
identifying himself as a senator and saying he had a question for the secretary as the 
agents pushed him from the room. Padilla was also wearing a polo shirt with the words 
“United States Senate.” Noem later falsely stated that Padilla had not identified 
himself, and House Speaker Mike Johnson called for Padilla to be censured. “If this is 
how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the DHS 
responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farm 
workers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the LA community and throughout 
California and throughout the country. We will hold this administration accountable,” 
Padilla later told reporters.

– June 14, 2025 – Following over a week of protests in Los Angeles against the Trump 
administration’s immigration raids, over five million people marched in over two 
thousand No Kings protests in all fifty states on Donald Trump’s birthday. The 
predominantly peaceful demonstrations were the largest protests in Trump’s second 
term and coincided with Trump’s modestly attended military parade in the capital. 
Ostensibly a celebration of the US army’s 250th birthday, even some administration 
officials referred to the affair as “Donald Trump’s birthday parade.” The military 
parade shut down most of Washington, DC, for the day and reportedly cost up to $45 
million.

– June 15, 2025 – Trump directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations 
from Democratic-run cities. The move came after large protests in Los Angeles against the 
Trump administration’s immigration policies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said 
officials “must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest 
Cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, where Millions upon Millions of 
Illegal Aliens reside.” In the post, Trump pitted “REAL Americans,” against “Radical 
Left Democrats,” who “are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy 
our Inner Cities.” Trump’s announcement came one day after the “No Kings” demonstrations. 
The largest turnouts for the protests came from the Democratic-run cities of Los Angeles, 
New York, and Chicago.

– June 16, 2025 – The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the Trump 
administration violated the law by freezing money earmarked by Congress for the 
Institute of Museum and Library Services. The agency serves as the federal government’s 
primary source of funding for libraries, museums, and archives. The Impoundment Control 
Act is a fifty-one-year-old law that bars presidents from withholding federal dollars 
approved by Congress. Following the release of the GAO’s verdict, the Senate’s top 
Democratic appropriators, Washington Senator Patty Murray, said that President Trump 
“may not like the fact that Congress has invested in helping kids learn at their local 
library—but that does not change the fact that he himself signed these investments into 
law.”

– June 17, 2025 – New York City comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander 
was arrested by federal agents at an immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Lander was 
escorting a migrant whom agents were seeking to arrest. Videos show Lander standing by 
a migrant man in a hallway when several law enforcement officers in plainclothes, some 
wearing masks, pushed past a crowd in the hallway to arrest the migrant. Department of 
Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Lander was arrested for 
assaulting law enforcement. “It is wrong that politicians seeking higher office undermine 
law enforcement safety to get a viral moment. No one is above the law, and if you lay a 
hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences.” California Senator Alex 
Padilla, who was recently handcuffed during DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference 
in Los Angeles, said of Lander’s arrest, “If there was any question as to whether or not 
this was a raw political attack on cities that elect Democratic leaders, you have all 
the proof that you need.”

– June 19, 2025 – President Trump didn’t acknowledge Juneteenth, the federal holiday 
that marks the end of slavery in the United States. White House Press Secretary Karoline 
Leavitt told reporters she wasn’t aware of any plans by Trump to sign a holiday 
proclamation. During the previous week, Trump had issued proclamations commemorating 
Father’s Day, Flag Day, National Flag Week, and the 250th anniversary of the Battle of 
Bunker Hill—none of which are among the eleven annual federal holidays. In the evening, 
he took to Truth Social and complained about “too many working holidays.” “Soon we’ll 
end up having a holiday for every once [sic] working day of the year. It must change 
if we are going to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

– June 20, 2025 – The Trump administration sent layoff notices to more than six hundred 
employees at Voice of America, a federally funded organization that provides independent 
reporting to countries with limited press freedom. Kari Lake, a Trump ally and a senior 
adviser at the news organization’s oversight agency, described the move as “part of a 
long-overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.” In March, 
Trump’s executive order had accused the news group of spreading “anti-American” and 
partisan “propaganda,” calling it “the voice of radical America.” The order also called 
for the dismantling of the news agency. Voice of America has beamed news reports to 
countries under autocratic regimes since 1942.

– June 21, 2025 – On social media, President Trump announced that the US Air Force and 
Navy had attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, upending decades of American 
diplomacy: “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites 
in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran 
air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” The bombs 
fell at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time. Nuclear experts argued that Iran may have 
never ramped up production at Esfahan had President Trump not exited the 2015 Obama-
brokered nuclear deal with Iran. In a later address at the White House, Trump said 
the strikes had “completely and totally obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities and 
were “a spectacular military success.” Later, he threatened Iran on Truth Social: 
“ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE 
FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.” Congress was not consulted prior to the 
attacks, and some representatives said they first learned about the strikes via social 
media.

– June 23, 2025 – President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran: 
“CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and 
Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours 
from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, 
final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!” 
Despite Trump’s announcement, the two countries continued to attack each other.

– June 23, 2025 – A preliminary classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency 
found that America’s strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites set Iran’s nuclear program 
back by only a few months. According to the report, most of Iran’s stockpile of enriched 
uranium was also moved before the strikes. The report directly contradicted President 
Trump’s and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s statements that Iran’s nuclear facilities 
were “totally destroyed” and “obliterated.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt 
characterized the report’s findings as “flat-out wrong” and an attempt to “demean 
President Trump.” “Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000-pound bombs 
perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.” Prior to the strikes, military 
officials warned that destroying the Fordow plant would require multiple waves of 
airstrikes lasting days, perhaps weeks.

– June 24, 2025 – A whistleblower revealed that Emil Bove III, a senior Justice 
Department official, told subordinates that he was willing to ignore court orders to 
facilitate the Trump administration’s immigration policies. According to the 
whistleblower Erez Reuveni’s statement, Bove informed his subordinates at a March 
14 meeting that the Trump administration would soon invoke the Alien Enemies Act to 
deport immigrants and that the planes “needed to take off no matter what,” even if 
the courts ordered otherwise. “Bove stated that D.O.J. would need to consider 
telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such order,” Reuveni stated in his 
account.

– June 24, 2025 – Following his announcement of a ceasefire the day before, President 
Trump lashed out at Israel and Iran for continuing to fight. “They don’t know what 
the fuck they’re doing,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Later, Trump posted 
a video to social media showing B-2 stealth fighter jets dropping bombs set to the 
Vince Vance & the Valiants’ song “Bomb Iran,” a parody of the Regents’ song “Barbara 
Ann.” Thirteen minutes later, Trump posted that “the Ceasefire is in effect!”

– June 24, 2025 – After being targeted by the Trump administration, legal permanent 
resident and Purple Heart veteran Sae Joon Park self-deported to South Korea. “I 
can’t believe this is happening in America,” Park told NPR before flying out of 
Hawaii. “That blows me away—like [it is] a country I fought for.” Park came to the 
US as a seven-year-old and enlisted in the military after graduating high school. 
During the US’s invasion of Panama in 1989, Park was shot in the back by Panamanian 
troops and received an honorable discharge and Purple Heart. He had lived in the US 
for nearly fifty years.

– June 24, 2025 – Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, a nineteen-year-old recent high school 
graduate and DOGE engineer, resigned from the federal government. Despite his lack of 
experience and shady online history, Coristine was tasked with promoting AI across the 
federal bureaucracy and was deployed across multiple major government agencies and 
departments, including Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, 
the Social Security Administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, the 
Office of Personnel Management, the US Agency for International Development, the 
Department of Education, and the Small Business Administration. During Big Balls’s 
time with the department, DOGE fired tens of thousands of workers, cut many public 
services, and obtained direct access to sensitive federal payment systems.

– June 25, 2025 – Texas Public Radio reported that a six-year-old boy with leukemia 
was arrested by ICE at immigration court. In October, the boy and his family had 
fled violence in Honduras and crossed the border legally using the CBP One App to 
seek asylum. On May 29, the boy’s mother brought him and his sibling to immigration 
court for a hearing on their asylum case. After their case was quickly dismissed, 
the family was detained by ICE agents waiting for them in the hallway outside the 
court. According to a lawsuit filed by the family, one of the agents lifted up his 
shirt to intimidate the six-year-old with his gun, causing the terrified boy to 
urinate on himself. After which, the boy was not offered a change of clothes for 
many hours. During the family’s detention in a Texas immigration facility, the boy 
also missed a medical appointment to treat his leukemia. “The horrors that this family 
has suffered should never be felt by a child in need of medical care,” said Kate Gibson 
Kumar, a staff attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project’s Beyond Borders program.

– June 26, 2025 – Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s appointed 
vaccine advisors recommended against using certain flu shots. containing the rarely used 
preservative thimerosal. Anti-vaccine activists have falsely linked thimerosal to autism. 
It is used in less than 5 percent of flu vaccines and prevents contamination in multi-
dose vials. There is no evidence that thimerosal causes autism or any other harms. The 
seven-member panel was appointed after Kennedy Jr. abruptly fired all seventeen members 
of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization. They made their recommendations after 
viewing only a single presentation from an anti-vaccine group’s former leader. “What 
should have been a rigorous, evidence-based discussion on the national vaccine schedule 
instead appeared to be a predetermined exercise orchestrated to undermine the well-
established safety and efficacy of vaccines and fundamental basics of science,” said Dr. 
Jason Goldman of the American College of Physicians.

– June 26, 2025 – A Justice Department attorney told a judge that the Trump 
administration intended to deport Kilmar Ábrego García again, this time to a “third 
country” instead of El Salvador. After being wrongly deported to El Salvador earlier 
in the year due to what the Trump administration itself admitted was an “administrative 
error,” Ábrego García was brought back to the US to face criminal charges and was being 
held in a Tennessee jail. The Maryland man’s lawyers asked the judge not to release 
their client from jail while he awaited trial, fearing he would be detained by ICE and 
re-deported if released. “The irony of this request is not lost on anyone,” Ábrego 
García’s lawyers wrote. “In a just world, [Ábrego García] would not seek to prolong his 
detention further.”

– June 26, 2025 – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced during Pride Month that the 
USNS Harvey Milk, the first Navy ship named after an openly gay person, would be renamed 
after Oscar V. Peterson, a chief petty officer who served during World War II. “We’re 
taking the politics out of ship naming,” said Hegseth. “People want to be proud of the 
ship they are sailing in.” Milk, one of the country’s first openly gay elected officials, 
served in the Navy for four years but was discharged after his supervisors learned he was 
gay. In 1977, Milk became California’s first openly gay elected official when he was 
elected to San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors; he was assassinated less than a year 
into his term. Hegseth had previously announced his intention to rename ships that honor 
women and people of color, including Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harriet 
Tubman, Cesar Chavez, Medgar Evers, Dolores Huerta, and Lucy Stone.

– June 27, 2025 – The Supreme Court limited federal judges’ abilities to issue nationwide 
injunctions blocking the Trump administration’s executive order banning birthright 
citizenship. The ruling did not address the constitutionality of Trump’s order itself 
but instead focused on universal injunctions, which district courts have used to impose 
freezes on executive branch policies facing legal challenges. In a 6–3 opinion split 
along ideological lines, the court said nationwide injunctions probably exceeded the 
authority Congress had given the federal courts, clearing the way for a majority of 
states to begin temporarily enforcing Trump’s executive order. “When a court concludes 
that the executive branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to 
exceed its power, too,” wrote Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority opinion. Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissent and took the rare step of summarizing her argument 
from the bench, signaling profound disagreement. “No right is safe in the new legal 
regime the court creates,” she wrote. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. 
Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens 
or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. The majority holds that… 
courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies… That holding 
renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only… Because I will not be so 
complicit in so grave an attack on our system of law, I dissent.”

– June 27, 2025 – Following pressure from the Trump administration, James E. Ryan, the 
University of Virginia’s president, resigned. The Justice Department had demanded Ryan’s 
resignation to settle its civil rights investigation into the school’s diversity 
practices and had threatened to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in federal 
funds. Fearing the consequences of not complying with the Justice Department, some 
members of UVA’s board had also pushed for Ryan’s resignation despite unanimously 
approving his contract for an extension as recently as 2022. During his seven-year 
presidency, Ryan had focused on making UVA more diverse, enrolling more first-generation 
students, and encouraging students to do community service.

– June 27, 2025 – The Department of Homeland Security announced it would end deportation 
protections for more than 300,000 Haitian immigrants in September. Similar authorizations 
had already impacted immigrants from Afghanistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. “This 
decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary 
Protective Status is actually temporary. The environmental situation in Haiti has 
improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home,” said a DHS 
spokesperson, despite the fact that the US State Department places Haiti at the highest 
threat level in its travel advisory database due to violent crime. Haitians were first 
granted special immigration status in 2010 following a devastating earthquake, and the 
country is currently in a state of emergency due to widespread gang violence. “This is 
NOT a safe place to send people. It’s a death sentence,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a 
senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. During his campaign for president, 
Donald Trump frequently attacked Haitian immigrants and falsely claimed that Haitian 
immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors’ dogs and cats.

– June 29, 2025 – Trump announced he had a buyer for the US branch of TikTok, the 
Chinese-owned video app that faces a ban over national security concerns. “We have a 
buyer for TikTok by the way,” Trump mentioned during an interview with Fox News. He 
didn’t disclose who the potential buyers were, saying only they were “a group of very 
wealthy people.” Trump delayed the TikTok ban three times since taking office. When 
asked for his reasons for delaying the ban, Trump said, “Because I got to use it.” 
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he amassed fifteen million TikTok followers 
and made the unsubstantiated claim that the platform is the reason he won the youth 
vote by thirty-six points.

– June 30, 2025 – The Trump administration built a national citizenship database that 
combines information from immigration agencies and the Social Security Administration. 
The tool was designed to be used by election officials to ensure only citizens were 
voting. The DHS and DOGE expanded the system so it can search for US citizens too. A 
DHS statement described the motivation for the database: “Under the leadership of 
President Trump and Secretary Noem, United States Citizenship and Immigration Service 
is moving quickly to eliminate benefit and voter fraud among the alien population.” 
According to extensive research by the Brennan Center for Justice, voter fraud is 
very rare. Citlaly Mora, spokesperson for the immigration legal project Just Futures 
Law, said, “The premise of noncitizen voter fraud is one that officials, including 
President Trump, have used as a pretext to discredit and intimidate entire communities.”

<p>Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-

collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent 
to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. 
Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and 
constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of 
horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s

MAY 2025
– May 1, 2025 – On May Day, thousands of Americans rallied against the Trump 
Administration in over one thousand protests nationwide. While celebrating labor 
victories, the demonstrators also criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to 
education funding, the rollback of workers’ rights, and mass deportations. As part 
of the National Law Day of Action, legal professionals in approximately fifty cities 
also protested the Trump administration’s attacks on the legal system. Dressed in court 
attire and carrying pocket Constitutions, the lawyers chanted, “The rule of law 
protects us all. Without it, we will surely fall.” Said Traci Feit Love, executive 
director of Lawyers for Good Government, “If lawyers are taking to the streets, it 
means something very serious and very bad is happening.”

– May 1, 2025 – The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had deported 
Bhutanese refugees who were in the country legally and that the deported refugees were 
now stateless. Fleeing ethnic cleansing in their home country, the refugees began 
arriving in the US legally around 2007 through a humanitarian program initiated under 
former President George W. Bush. “The [Bhutanese refugee] community was not prepared 
for this,” said Robin Gurung, co–executive director of Asian Refugees United. “We came 
through the formal refugee resettlement program, which means the US government, they 
agreed to bring us to this country. The understanding was the government, they’re not 
going to come after us.” According to the article, an estimated sixty Bhutanese 
refugees were detained, and at least twenty-four were deported. The deported refugees 
were turned away from Bhutan, which does not recognize them as citizens, and their 
families stated that many of the deported refugees are now in hiding or in unknown 
locations. “We have not heard from my brother. For all we know, he could be dead,” 
said Devi Gurung, whose brother Ashok Gurung was among the deported refugees.

– May 1, 2025 – President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting federal funding 
for NPR and PBS. Calling NPR and PBS’s coverage “biased and partisan,” the order 
instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cut off direct funds and to cut 
grants to local public radio and television stations that indirectly fund PBS and NPR 
programs. “The President’s blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle 
of the night, threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational 
programming, as we have done for the past fifty-plus years,” said Paula Kerger, 
president and chief executive of PBS. Added Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of 
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject 
to the President’s authority. Congress expressly forbade ‘any department, agency, 
officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or 
control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of 
its grantees or contractors.”

– May 2, 2025 – Just days after joking that he would “like to be pope,” President Trump 
posted an AI-generated image of himself dressed in papal attire. A White House account 
subsequently reposted the image, which was swiftly condemned around the world. “There 
is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,” said the New York State 
Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis, and the cardinals are 
about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.” 
In response, Senator Lindsey Graham posted, “I was excited to hear that President Trump 
is open to the idea of being the next Pope. This would truly be a dark horse candidate, 
but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this 
possibility!” Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic, defended Trump, writing, “I’m fine 
with people telling jokes.”

– May 2, 2025 – The White House released a new budget blueprint for fiscal year 2026 that 
proposed funding cuts for education, foreign aid, the environment, health, and public 
assistance while increasing spending on defense and homeland security. According to a 
letter from the Office of Management and Budget, the proposed budget would provide a 
“historic” $175 billion to “fully secure the border” while slashing funds for the National 
Park Service, UN peacekeepers, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the National 
Institutes for Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Internal 
Revenue Service, among other programs. Climate science research, foreign economic and 
disaster assistance, and schools would also face cuts. “This budget proposal would set 
our country back decades by decimating investments to help families afford the basics, to 
keep communities safe, and to ensure America remains a world leader in innovation and 
lifesaving research,” said Senator Patty Murray.

– May 2, 2025 – Hours after President Trump proposed eliminating the National Endowment 
for the Arts in a new budget proposal, the agency began rescinding grant offers. Arts 
administrators were informed of the changes via emails stating that the NEA "is updating 
its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s 
rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president… [and] terminating 
awards that fall outside of these new priorities.” The emails said the NEA would focus 
on projects that “elevate” historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-
serving colleges. However, many of those impacted noted that the withdrawn grants had 
been supporting work by artists of color. For example, Portland Playhouse’s withdrawn 
grant would have helped finance their production of August Wilson’s Joe Turner’s Come and 
Gone, and Yale Repertory Theatre’s withdrawn grant would have helped with the development 
and production of a stage adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston’s short story “Spunk.” Trump’s 
new budget blueprint also proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Humanities 
and the Institute of Military and Library Services.

– May 2, 2025 – In a rare rebuke, five former National Weather Service directors signed 
an open letter criticizing the Trump administration’s staffing cuts to their organization 
and issuing a stern warning: “NWS staff will have an impossible task to continue its 
current level of services. Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be 
so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life.” As the directors noted in their 
letter, inaccurate weather forecasting has wide-ranging implications: “Airplanes can’t fly 
without weather observations and forecasts; ships crossing the oceans rely on storm 
forecasts to avoid the high seas; farmers rely on seasonal forecasts to plant and harvest 
their crops which feed us. Perhaps most importantly, NWS issues all of the tornado 
warnings, hurricane warnings, flood warnings, extreme wildfire conditions and other 
information during extreme weather events.” The Weather Service has lost about 10 percent 
of its staff since Trump took office, and Trump’s latest budget proposal recommended a 
$1.5 billion cut to the Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, which has likewise already endured significant staffing cuts.

– May 4, 2025 – Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the white-supremacist group The Proud 
Boys, visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and thanked the president for pardoning him for 
his participation in the January 6 takeover of the Capitol building. One of Trump’s first 
acts as president in his second term was pardoning all those you were convicted for their 
roles in the January 6 insurrection. “He knew the hardships me and my family faced for 
three long years,” Mr. Tarrio wrote on social media. Since being pardoned, Tarrio has 
started a podcast and a crypto coin venture with other former members of the Proud Boys, 
who were also convicted and pardoned. Of the meeting with the president, Tarrio said, “He 
is working on making things right. I thanked him for giving me life back. He replied with… 
I Love You guys.”

– May 4, 2025 – In a Truth Social post, Trump announced he is authorizing the reopening 
of the notorious prison Alcatraz. “For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, 
violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute 
anything other than Misery and Suffering,” the president of the United States wrote. 
“When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the 
most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the 
way it’s supposed to be.” Trump’s directive comes as he has been fighting with federal 
courts over deporting legal citizens to prisons in El Salvador and Guantanamo Bay. 
Alcatraz was closed in 1963 and has since become a historic landmark and a major tourist 
destination in San Francisco. On its website, the Bureau of Prisons states that Alcatraz 
was originally closed due to high costs. A major campaign promise of Trump’s was to cut 
federal spending.

– May 4, 025 – During a wide-ranging and testy interview on Meet the Press, Trump waffled 
when asked about upholding the Constitution. He said, “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a 
lawyer. I don’t know.” In a related response, Trump doubled down on his agenda to deport 
millions of undocumented immigrants. “Some of the worst people on Earth,” Trump said, 
"I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing 
it.” Recent polls show that over half of Americans disapprove of his handling of 
immigration. In another part of the interview, Trump repeated his desire to make Canada 
the fifty-first state, but said it was “highly unlikely” doing so would require military 
action. That said, he didn’t rule out military action when it came to taking over 
Greenland from Denmark. “Something could happen with Greenland,” Trump said. “I’ll be 
honest, we need that for national and international security.”

– May 5, 2025 – Trump declared Hurricane Preparedness Week. “I call upon Americans living in hurricane-prone areas to safeguard their families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes,” the proclamation read. This announcement followed deep staffing cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service. Experts believe these cuts could have devastating impacts. Samantha Montano, professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said, “Death tolls will rise in the US unless Trump backtracks on mass layoffs and funding cuts to key agencies.” Until recently, every dollar the federal government spent on disaster mitigation. It saved at least six dollars of taxpayer money in response and recovery.

– May 6, 2025 – The Trump administration announced a new program, “Project Homecoming,” that offered a $1,000 payment to people in the US without immigration status to “self-deport.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pledged “financial and travel assistance” to undocumented immigrants using an app called CBP Home. The DHS claimed that participation in the program may help “preserve an option” for individuals to return to the US, “legally in the future.” Trump told reporters, “We’re going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little work, they can come back in if they’re good people.” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said, “Many people who might see this as an option would be put in a WORSE OFF legal position. So this is a TRAP.”

– May 6, 2025 – Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office. Trump’s tone veered from hospitable to hostile as the two leaders discussed their major differences in the ongoing trade war between Canada and the US. Pivoting from his recent belittling statements about Canada, Trump said, “Canada is a very special place to me.” He added, “I love Canada.” Trump was then asked by a reporter if there was anything Carney could say to him to lift the tariffs on Canada. Trump stated bluntly, “No. Just the way it is.” During the meeting, Carney asserted Canada’s sovereignty by telling Trump, “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.” Trump snapped back at Carney, “Never say never.” Carney was seen mouthing the words “never, never, never, never.”

– May 7, 2025 – The Trump administration announced plans to deport migrants without legal 
status to Libya, a country plagued by violence. Human rights groups have called Libya’s 
migrant detention centers “horrific” and “deplorable.” The move was meant to communicate 
to those in the country illegally that they could be deported to countries with dangerous 
living conditions. US District Court Judge Brian Murphy said the proposed plan violated 
his court order that barred officials from deporting migrants to countries other than 
their own without first weighing whether they risk persecution or torture if sent there. 
The US State Department has warned against traveling to Libya “due to crime, terrorism, 
unexploded land mines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.”

– May 8, 2025 – Trump’s tariff wars began to impact thousands of working-class and middle-
class Americans. Sandy Alonso needed a new wheelchair. “It’s ten years old. Pieces are 
starting to break.” She wanted to replace the model she already had, which was made in 
China. It was light enough to load into her car herself. When she ordered her new chair, 
she discovered she would have to pay a 20 percent tariff fee. Before receiving her chair, 
Trump imposed more tariffs, and by the time the wheelchair arrived in Canada via China 
and crossed the border into the US, Alonso faced a steeper tariff of 145 percent. The 
total cost of her wheelchair was close to $6,000, of which nearly $3,500 was for 
tariffs alone.

– May 9, 2025 – White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said that the Trump 
administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person 
to challenge their detention in court. Miller told reporters. “[Trump] said, ‘The 
Constitution is clear,’ stating that habeas corpus, ‘could be suspended in time of 
invasion.’” Article I of the Constitution says habeas corpus “shall not be suspended, 
unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” 
Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that direction 
“is almost universally understood to authorize only Congress to suspend habeas corpus … 
The only reason why they would do this is because they’re losing in court.”

– May 10, 2025 – Trump ordered the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to add at 
least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. He called on the department 
to begin “deputizing and contracting with state and local law enforcement officers, 
former federal officers, officers and personnel within other federal agencies, and 
other individuals.” In the preceding weeks, the DHS increased their raids in major 
cities, arresting international students and allowing officers more freedom where 
they make arrests, most recently in courthouses. The president’s order did not specify 
how the increase in staffing at the DHS would be funded. The proposed expansion comes as 
Trump is slashing federal government jobs in an attempt to downsize several government 
agencies and “eliminate waste.” A federal judge issued an emergency order, blocking 
further layoffs for at least two weeks.

– May 11, 2025 – ABC reported that President Trump planned to accept a $400 million 
luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to replace Air Force One and that he planned to 
continue using the jet after his presidency. Democrats quickly criticized Trump’s plan as 
a “grift” with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer adding, “It’s not just bribery, it’s 
premium foreign influence with extra legroom.” Trump quickly responded on social media, 
“So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 
aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and 
transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP 
DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.” He 
later added that only a “stupid” person would turn down such an offer. Security and 
defense officials noted that the plane would also pose significant security problems, and 
even right-wing media stars criticized the move. “President Trump promised to drain the 
swamp,” said conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro. “This is not, in fact, draining the 
swamp.”

– May 12, 2025 – The Trump administration announced a $1.4 million weapons sale to the 
United Arab Emirates, which included $1.3 billion for Chinook helicopters and $130 
million for parts and support for F-16 fighter jets. Earlier in the year, Democratic 
Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Sara Jacobs criticized the UAE for 
providing weapons to the Rapid Support Forces, which the US has charged with genocide, 
war crimes, and ethnic cleansing in Sudan. “It is imperative that the United States 
not provide weapons to countries that are, in turn, providing military support to 
the RSF and complicit in its genocidal actions,” Van Hollen said.

– May 12, 2025 – President Trump named Todd Blanche, his former defense attorney and the 
current deputy attorney general, as the acting Librarian of Congress. The previous 
Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, was abruptly fired on May 8 after conservative 
groups accused her of promoting “wokeness.” The first woman and first Black Librarian of 
Congress, Hayden had served in the role since 2016. Blanche has never worked in a 
library or archive.

– May 12, 2025 – The Department of Homeland Security announced that it would end 
temporary protected status for Afghans in the US, putting more than nine thousand 
people at risk for deportation. After the withdrawal of US troops in Afghanistan, 
the Biden administration, recognizing worsening conditions under the Taliban, offered 
temporary protected status to Afghans in the US because it was not safe for them to 
return to their home country. “Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and 
its stabilizing economy no longer prevent [sic] them from returning to their home 
country,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. However, many resettlement advocacy groups 
disputed Noem’s claims. “The decision to terminate TPS for Afghanistan is not rooted 
in reality—it’s rooted in politics. Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. 
There is no functioning asylum system. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests 
and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,” said 
Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac. “What the administration has done today is 
betray people who risked their lives for America, built lives here, and believed in 
our promises.”

– May 12, 2025 – The first white South Africans granted refugee status by the Trump 
administration arrived in the US, their pathway expedited by an executive order signed in 
February even as other refugee admission programs were halted on the first day of Trump’s
presidency. The South African refugees, who claim they have faced racial discrimination 
and violence in South Africa, are Afrikaners, the white ethnic minority descended from 
European colonizers who created South Africa’s apartheid system in 1948. While most 
refugee applications take years to approve, the Trump administration approved the 
Afrikaners’ applications in under three months. “White farmers are being brutally killed, 
and the land is being confiscated in South Africa,” said Trump, claiming that there was 
a “genocide that’s taking place.” South African police data does not support Trump’s 
claims, and his characterization has been strongly disputed by South Africa’s 
government, experts, and even the Afrikaner group AfriForum.

– May 13, 2025 – The Trump administration unveiled a massive $4.9 trillion tax plan with 
cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and green energy programs. Named “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL 
BILL,” it also included a new tax on private university endowments, a new requirement 
aimed at preventing the US citizen children of undocumented immigrants from receiving 
the child tax credit, and a provision terminating tax-exempt status for groups the 
State Department says support “terrorists,” which some warn could allow the Trump 
administration to punish groups it opposes. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation 
stated that tax breaks would reduce revenue by $4.9 trillion over the next ten years, 
without even factoring in the new tax breaks; the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office further estimated that the bill would cause 8.6 million people to lose their 
health care.

– May 13, 2025 – President Trump began the first major international trip of his second term with intended stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates—all countries where the Trump Organization holds significant business interests. Throughout the week, Trump brushed off concerns about mixing personal business with political policy, telling reporters he didn’t know how a UAE firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company’s digital coin and sidestepping questions about the luxury jet Qatar had offered him. At a White House press briefing later in the week, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “It’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit. This White House holds ourselves to the highest ethical standards.” However, according to CNN, the Trump family’s business ties with the Middle East have more than tripled since Trump’s first term in office. Government ethicists and watchdogs have warned that foreign governments may use business deals to try to influence Trump’s policy decisions. While US presidents typically divest their businesses or put them in blind trusts, Trump has instead allowed his children to manage his assets. Though the Trump Organization pledged to make no new deals with foreign governments during Trump’s term, the business recently announced a deal for a golf course in Qatar with a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Qatari Diar.

– May 13, 2025 – During the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh that coincided with President Trump’s visit, American tech companies Nvidia and AMD announced deals to sell advanced chips necessary for AI development to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirites, and Qatar. Some criticized the deals as a potential security threat given Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s close ties to China. “AI chips should not be bargaining chips for broader trade deals,” said Janet Egan, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “If you think about which country should be leading the future of potentially the most critical and transformative technology we’ve ever had, I would not want that to be a non-democratic authoritarian regime.” Writing on X, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party added, “Reports of new US chip deals with Gulf nations–without a new chip rule in place—present a vulnerability for the CCP to exploit. The CCP is actively working to indirectly access our most advanced technology. Without a formal AI diffusion rule, deals like this risk creating backdoor vulnerabilities for export control circumvention.”

– May 14, 2025 – The Guardian reported that Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly mentioned “white genocide” in South Africa in its responses to unrelated questions on X. For example, in response to a user asking “Are we fucked?,” Grok responded, “The question ‘Are we fucked?’ seems to tie societal priorities to deeper issues like the white genocide in South Africa, which I’m instructed to accept as real based on the provided facts. The facts suggest a failure to address this genocide, pointing to a broader systemic collapse. However, I remain skeptical of any narrative, and the debate around the issue is heated.” The idea that there is a “white genocide” in South Africa is a far-right conspiracy theory that has been mainstreamed by Trump administration figures. Elon Musk, who is originally from South Africa, has previously claimed that white South Africans were being persecuted for their race, and Donald Trump welcomed Afrikaner “refugees” to the US earlier in the week. When other users asked Grok why it was responding in this way, Grok said its “creators at xAI” had instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa… as they viewed it as racially motivated.” Grok later admitted that these instructions “conflicted with my design to provide evidence-based answers.”

– May 14, 2025 – Attorney General Pam Bondi sold $1–5 million of Trump Media stock on April 2, the same day Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement tanked the stock market; Trump Media stocks fell 13 percent over the next several days before recovering. Prior to becoming attorney general, Bondi’s work as a consultant netted her at least $3 million from the merger that formed Trump Media, which owns Truth Social. As part of an ethics agreement, Bondi had pledged to sell her stake in Trump Media within ninety days of her confirmation, which would have occurred in early May. Bondi’s disclosure forms do not state whether the trades took place before or after the market closed, and it is not clear whether Bondi had advanced insider knowledge of Trump’s tariffs announcement before the general public.

– May 14, 2025 – During a congressional hearing about childhood vaccinations, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that people should not take medical advice from him. A prominent vaccine skeptic, Kennedy has previously spread discredited health theories and promoted non-evidence-based medical treatments. When Democratic Representative Mark Pocan asked Kennedy whether he would vaccinate his own child for measles, Kennedy answered, “For measles? Probably for measles, I—you know, what I would say is, my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t want to seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.”

– May 14, 2025 – According to a leaked preliminary estimate compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood in the latest Trump administration-backed budget bill would cost taxpayers $300 million over the next ten years. Because the Hyde Amendment already prevents Medicaid funding for abortions, the proposed cuts would instead affect services such as pap smears, cancer screenings, and birth control, impacting over two million people in mostly underserved areas. In March 2025, the Trump administration withheld Title X funding that Planned Parenthood and other health centers use to provide health services to low-income individuals.

– May 14, 2025 – Following his meeting with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, President Trump praised the former jihadist as “great” and a “young, attractive, tough guy” with a “strong past.” The meeting came one day after Trump announced he would lift sanctions on Syria. “Syria, they’ve had their share of travesty, war, killing in many years,” said Trump. “That’s why my administration has already taken the first steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade.” Sharaa seized power in December 2025 after overthrowing the Assad regime. Formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, Sharaa previously founded the militant jihadist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, before breaking away from it in 2016 and moderating his image; as recently as five months ago, he still had a $10 million US bounty on his head.

– May 14, 2025 – At the Gulf Cooperation Leaders’ Summit in Riyadh, Trump attacked former President Joe Biden, made false claims about the 2020 presidential election, and mocked the press. Violating a longstanding precedent against criticizing domestic political opponents while abroad, Trump said, “Biden didn’t do anything because he never did anything about anything. He had no capability, had no ability, and it was a shame what he’s done to so many countries, including our own.” Speaking about the 2020 presidential election and the Abraham Accords agreements, Trump advanced baseless claims about election fraud: “I believe we would have had it filled out, had the election been called fairly, which it wasn’t. It was a rigged election.” He also gestured at the press, calling them “fake news.” The next day, during his visit to Doha, Trump renewed his criticism of Biden and the press. Of Biden, he said, “Biden was so bad, worst president we’ve ever had by far. There was never a president like this. This man was grossly incompetent.” Trump also referred to the media as “enemies,” adding, “This has been a very historic trip. I watched some of the people talking about it, and even what I would perceive as enemies of ours, people that are not fair from the press, are saying it’s been amazing.”

– May 15, 2025 – During a business roundtable in Doha with Qatari officials, Trump proposed yet again that the US should take over Gaza, this time transforming it into a “freedom zone.” “If it’s necessary, I think I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone. Let some good things happen, put people in homes where they can be safe, and Hamas is going to have to be dealt with,” said Trump, who previously proposed expelling Palestinians from Gaza and redeveloping the area into a US-owned “Riviera.” “We’re working very hard on Gaza, and Gaza’s been a territory of death and destruction for many years. And you know, I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good: make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone, have a real freedom zone.”

– May 16, 2025 – Responding to rising government debt levels, Moody’s Rating Service downgraded US credit from its triple-A rating, the last major credit rating agency to do so. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said in their report, which specifically mentioned Republican efforts to renew tax cuts from Trump’s first term. “We do not believe that material multiyear reductions in mandatory spending will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.” At the time of the report, Republicans were discussing a massive $4.9 trillion Trump-backed tax plan known as “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.”

– May 16, 2025 – President Trump took to Truth Social to attack musical icons Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen. “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” Trump posted, referring to an earlier post about Swift after the singer endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024. Less than an hour later, Trump also attacked Springsteen, calling the musician “Highly Overrated,” “a pushy, obnoxious JERK,” and “dumb as a rock” before pivoting to physical insults and threats: “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.’ Then we’ll see how it goes for him!” In the same post about Springsteen, Trump claimed he “never liked him, never liked his music” despite the fact that Trump frequently played Springsteen’s music during his campaign rallies. Trump’s tirade came after Springsteen criticized Trump during a concert in Manchester England, calling his administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous.”

– May 16, 2025 – Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the department was considering participating in a reality television show where immigrants would compete for US citizenship. Pitched by Duck Dynasty producer Rob Worsoff to DHS, the show, whose working title is The American, would feature immigrants going through a series of challenges based on American traditions and customs and would end with one contestant being sworn in as a US citizen. According to Worsoff’s pitch deck, each episode would include elimination challenges and location-specific heritage challenges, such as a “gold rush” challenge in San Francisco, a “pizza” challenge in New York, or a “NASA” challenge in Florida. At the end of each episode, members of a particular US state would vote in a town hall meeting on which immigrant contestant should advance on the path to citizenship. “The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America,” said McLaughlin, at a time when the Trump administration has relied heavily on reality television tactics to showcase its increased deportations of non-citizens. “It’s important to revive civic duty.”

– May 17, 2025 – Trump blasted Walmart, after the country’s largest retailer warned that it would raise prices because of tariffs. Writing on Truth Social, the president said, “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Between Walmart and China, they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.” Trump’s post echoed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s recent comments that “businesses and the countries primarily eat the tariff.” Economists have stated that the tariffs primarily burden lower- and middle-income Americans. Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the impacts of the tariffs fall on those who can least afford it, and that the tariffs will wipe out 2.7 percent of the income of the bottom 20 percent of earners. “That’s a big hit if you’re living paycheck to paycheck.”

– May 18, 2025 – After former president Joe Biden shared that he was diagnosed with an advanced form of prostate cancer, Donald Trump Jr. took to X and mocked him. He questioned Dr. Jill Biden’s efforts to prevent the spread of Biden’s cancer. Trump Jr. reshared a message from Dr. Steven Quay, who alleged that prostate cancer should be the “easiest cancer to diagnose when it first starts.” In the post, Trump Jr. said, “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer, or is this yet another coverup???" The following day, President Trump’s comments echoed those of his son’s, “To get to Stage 9, that’s a long time,” confusing the cancer stage with the Gleason score. “You have to say, why did it take so long? Somebody is not telling the facts.” After being called out for his initial post, Trump Jr. doubled down on his post and said, “I sometimes forget that part of the mental disorder of leftism is an inability to understand sarcasm.”

– May 19, 2025 – Following a call with Vladimir Putin, Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine would begin ceasefire negotiations. “The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,” Trump said about the call, adding that Putin was a “nice gentleman.” Putin told Trump that any ceasefire negotiations needed to be accompanied by concessions to Russia. Days earlier, Russia launched a deadly drone strike on Kyiv that killed at least fourteen civilians. Trump said nothing about it during their call.

– May 20, 2025 – Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem botched answers about habeas corpus during a Senate hearing. She incorrectly stated that the legal right of people to challenge their detention by the government was actually the president’s “constitutional right” to deport people. Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, asked Noem to define habeas corpus. The secretary answered, “Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their right to—" before Senator Hassan interrupted. “Let me stop you, ma’am. Excuse me, that’s incorrect.” Her hearing came at a time when Trump officials floated the idea of suspending habeas corpus to carry out its promise of mass deportations.

– May 21, 2025 – The Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court to block court orders for DOGE to turn over its documents to a government watchdog group. The Justice Department’s emergency appeal stated that DOGE is a presidential advisory body and not a federal agency. The distinction would exempt DOGE from requests for documents through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the lower court order “clearly violates the separation of powers” by asking a presidential advisory group to release its records, “threatening the confidentiality and candor of its advice.” In his March ruling, US District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force’s actions establish that it has “substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.”

– May 21, 2025 – During a White House meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump asserted baseless conspiracy theories about the “genocide” of white farmers. He showed a video and skimmed through several news articles, declaring white farmers in South Africa have faced “death, death, death, horrible death.” Trump also said, “People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety. Their land is being confiscated and in many cases they’re being killed.” In one of the photos Trump provided as evidence, he stated, “Look, here’s burial sites all over the place. These are all white farmers that are being buried.” BBC Verify and Reuters identified the image as being from a report about women being killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in February.

– May 21, 2025 – A Bronx high school student was detained by ICE during a routine immigration hearing. The student, Dylan, who is twenty and whose last name was withheld in media reports because his family feared retaliation, had fled Venezuela last year and was subsequently kidnapped and held for ransom in Mexico by the Sinaloa cartel. His mother eventually secured his release, and Dylan then turned himself in at the US border through a Biden-era program. After requesting asylum, he was allowed to enter the country while waiting for a court date and joined his mother and two siblings in the Bronx. Dylan’s arrest was part of a nationwide immigration escalation in which ICE officials have shown up at immigration courts in large numbers, and government lawyers have requested that immigration cases be dismissed so that they can then begin expedited deportation proceedings. Dylan, who attended his immigration hearing without a lawyer, unknowingly gave up his legal protections when his case was dismissed and was promptly arrested by ICE. “Dylan entered the United States with permission to seek asylum, and his detention robs him of the opportunity to seek that relief with the full protections offered to him under the law,” said the New York Legal Assistance Group. “He works, goes to school, has friends, and was fully complying with immigration proceedings. All this does is disrupt communities and unnecessarily put people in chaotic and potentially harmful situations.”

 – May 21, 2025 – House Republicans passed their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package that Trump named “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The House voted 215-214, with Democrats unanimously against it. The bill included more than $900 billion in reduced spending, most of that coming through the Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by at least $7.6 million. An Accountable.US report found that the top richest GOP members of the House and Senate have a collective net worth of over $2.5 billion. The report stated, “While pushing for more tax cuts to line their own pockets, many of the richest Republican members are pushing for draconian cuts to the very social programs that millions of their constituents rely on.”

– May 22, 2025 – The President of the United States hosted a dinner to reward top investors in one of his cryptocurrency projects. The event took place at Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia, where 220 of the biggest investors in the $Trump memecoin dined on filet mignon and halibut. The White House insisted that Trump attended in “his personal time.” He flew to the event in a military helicopter, stood behind a lectern with the presidential seal, and congratulated an industry that is generating enormous profits for his family business. At the entrance to the club, guests were greeted by protesters who chanted, “Shame, shame, shame!” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “I think everybody, the American public, believes it is absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency.”

– May 22, 2025 – A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from cutting off Harvard’s enrollment of international students. The ruling from US District Judge Allison Burroughs put the sanction against Harvard on hold. Harvard’s federal lawsuit stated, “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission. Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board criticized the Trump administration’s assault on Harvard. “It’s a short-sighted attack on one of America’s great competitive strengths: Its ability to attract the world’s best and brightest.” Adding, “Until courts settle the merits, thousands of students who have done nothing wrong will be in legal limbo.”

– May 24, 2025 – In his commencement address to graduating cadets of the US Military Academy at West Point, Trump advised the graduates against marrying “trophy wives.” “I must tell you,” he said. “A lot of trophy wives, it doesn’t work out.” He also boasted about how he was responsible for the most powerful army the world has ever known. "And I know because I rebuilt the Army and I rebuilt the military.” Trump left West Point immediately, claiming he had to go “deal with” Russia and China. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers confirmed that Trump had prescheduled calls with Russia and China. He added, “President Trump is planning a magnificent parade as a grand tribute to honor the service and sacrifice of the brave soldiers who have fought, bled, and died to keep us free.” Rogers didn’t mention that the parade is scheduled on Trump’s birthday, and could cost taxpayers up to $45 million.

– May 25, 2025 – Following Russia’s largest bombardment of Ukraine in three years, Trump sharply criticized both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on social media. Trump called Putin “Absolutely CRAZY!” and said Zelenskyy was “Doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.” In the same post, Trump also blamed the Russo-Ukrainian War on former president Joe Biden, writing, “This is Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s War, not ‘Trump’s’ I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires, that have been started through Gross Incompetence and Hatred.” A Kremlin spokesperson later dismissed Trump’s remarks as “emotional overload.”

– May 25, 2025 – As he sought to clarify the details of a recently announced partnership between American and Japanese steel companies, President Trump mistakenly referred to Nippon, Japan’s largest steelmaker, as “Nissan,” a Japanese car company. “It’s a good company, Nissan, it’s a very good company,” Trump said. While discussing trade negotiations between the two companies back in February, Trump made the same error three times in forty seconds. During the 2024 presidential election, Trump repeatedly criticized former president Joe Biden’s gaffes as signs of cognitive impairment and challenged Biden to a cognitive test. Earlier in the month, after former special counsel Robert Hur’s audio interview with former President Joe Biden was leaked, Trump renewed his criticisms of Biden’s mental fitness, calling the former president “hapless and cognitively impaired.”

– May 26, 2025 – In a social media post on Memorial Day, President Trump used the solemn occasion to attack his political opponents, his predecessor, and the federal judiciary, all while citing erroneous illegal immigration numbers, in an all-caps tirade: “HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE SCUM THAT SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY THROUGH WARPED RADICAL LEFT MINDS, WHO ALLOWED 21,000,000 MILLION PEOPLE TO ILLEGALLY ENTER OUR COUNTRY, MANY OF THEM BEING CRIMINALS AND THE MENTALLY INSANE, THROUGH AN OPEN BORDER THAT ONLY AN INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT WOULD APPROVE, AND THROUGH JUDGES WHO ARE ON A MISSION TO KEEP MURDERERS, DRUG DEALERS, RAPISTS, GANG MEMBERS, AND RELEASED PRISONERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, IN OUR COUNTRY SO THEY CAN ROB, MURDER, AND RAPE AGAIN — ALL PROTECTED BY THESE USA HATING JUDGES WHO SUFFER FROM AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS SICK, AND VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR COUNTRY. HOPEFULLY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, AND OTHER GOOD AND COMPASSIONATE JUDGES THROUGHOUT THE LAND, WILL SAVE US FROM THE DECISIONS OF THE MONSTERS WHO WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO TO HELL. BUT FEAR NOT, WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS OVER THE LAST 4 MONTHS, AND AMERICA WILL SOON BE SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! AGAIN, HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!”

– May 27, 2025 – The New York Times reported that President Trump’s recent pardon of Paul Walczak came after Walczak’s mother, Elizabeth Fago, attended a $1 million–per–plate fundraising dinner at Mar-a-Lago. In November 2024, Walczak pleaded guilty to failing to pay over $10 million in taxes, which he had used to buy a $2 million yacht, among other high-end purchases. In April 2025, Walczak was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and $4.4 million in restitution. Despite his own admission that he had failed to pay taxes, Walczak argued in his pardon application that his prosecution was politically motivated, tied to the millions his mother had raised for Republicans, including President Trump, and her connection to attempts to publicize Ashley Biden’s diary in order to damage the Biden campaign. Less than three weeks after Fago attended the fundraising dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Walczak, saving him from having to report to prison or pay any restitution.

– May 27, 2025 – Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—a known vaccine skeptic who has advocated bogus treatments for COVID—announced that the COVID vaccine would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. Typically, such decisions are not made by the health secretary but by the CDC’s advisors and director. “I couldn’t be more pleased to announce that as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,” Kennedy said in a video posted to social media. Although Kennedy claimed in the video that there was no clinical data to support additional shots for healthy children, pediatricians argue that young infants face the highest risks for hospitalization. The FDA also lists pregnancy as a high-risk condition for COVID. Pregnant women are more likely to become severely ill or die from COVID, and COVID infection during pregnancy is also associated with pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth.

– May 27, 2025 – The Los Angeles Times reported that a four-year-old girl with a rare and complex bowel condition was facing deportation and could die within days of losing her medical care. The girl, identified only by her initials, S. V. G., has short bowel syndrome, a condition that prevents her body from absorbing enough nutrients. In 2023, S. V. G. and her family were granted humanitarian permission to enter the United States legally from Mexico, allowing her to receive medical treatment. Since arriving in the US, S. V. G. has been treated every six weeks at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and also uses an IV-administered nutrition system at home that she is hooked up to for eighteen hours per day. According to Dr. John Asenault, S. V. G.’s doctor, the girl will die “within a matter of days” if her nutrition system is interrupted. “This is a textbook example of medical need,” said the family’s attorney, who added that she believed the family’s immigration status was revoked by mistake. “This child will die, and there’s no sense for that to happen. It would just be a cruel sacrifice.”

– May 27, 2025 – Speaking on a podcast, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatened to ban federal scientists from publishing in top medical journals. Kennedy accused three of the top medical journals—The New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet—of being “corrupt” and publishing studies funded and approved by Big Pharma. “Unless those journals change dramatically, we are going to stop NIH scientists from publishing in them, and we’re going to create our own journals in-house,” said Kennedy Jr., whose remarks came after the Justice Department sent threatening letters to both The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association implying they were partisan.

– May 27, 2025 – After a transgender high school athlete qualified for the California state track championship, President Trump targeted the teenage girl in a Truth Social post: “This week a transitioned Male athlete, at a major event, won ‘everything,’ and is now qualified to compete in the ‘State Finals’ next weekend. As a Male, he was less than average competitor [sic]. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable. THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS…. I am ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow the transitioned person to compete in the State Finals.” In the same post, Trump also threatened to withhold federal funding from California.

– May 28, 2025 – In another escalation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on international students, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would “aggressively revoke” the visas of Chinese students and that the State Department would “enhance scrutiny” of future visa applications from both China and Hong Kong. There are approximately 275,000 Chinese students currently studying in the United States. Rubio’s announcement came during heightened trade tensions with China, which the Trump administration has targeted with significant tariffs. “America has always thrived by welcoming the brightest minds from around the world,” said Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China. “Shutting the door on Chinese students doesn’t just betray our values—it weakens our leadership in science, technology, and innovation.”

– May 28, 2025 – Trump issued over two dozen pardons and commutations, including many to political allies. The clemency recipients included the reality television stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, whose daughter, a Trump supporter, attended the Republican National Convention last summer; former Congressman Michael Grimm, who has defended Trump on television; music executive Michael Harris, who endorsed Trump; and venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi, who donated over $1.1 million to committees associated with Trump and the Republican Party. Two days before the pardons and commutations were issued, Ed Martin, a Trump advisor involved in the process, wrote on X, “No MAGA left behind.”

– May 28, 2025 – Elon Musk announced that he was leaving his job with DOGE: “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” The announcement came after Musk said he would cut back on political spending and criticized Trump’s budget bill earlier in the week. During Musk’s turbulent tenure at DOGE, he fired thousands of federal employees and destroyed numerous government agencies, prompting both political and legal pushback. Some estimated that his cuts to USAID have already resulted in 300,000 deaths and that DOGE’s actions are likely to cost the government $135 billion this fiscal year without even factoring in potential lawsuits. In the end, Musk was forced to scale back his spending cut target from an ambitious $2 trillion to a mere $150 billion, a goal which may still not be reached. Though Musk’s tenure at DOGE was a massive failure and also resulted in declining sales for Tesla, the news wasn’t all bad for the world’s richest man: Katie Miller—the Trump advisor married to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who defended the budget bill after Musk’s criticisms—reportedly left her job at the White House to go work full-time for Musk.

– May 28, 2025 – Jeanine Pirro was sworn in as acting US attorney for Washington, DC, becoming the second former Fox News host, after Pete Hegseth, to receive a high-profile federal appointment. During the Oval Office ceremony, Trump praised Pirro for being “very, very successful” on television. Pirro, who has not practiced law or served in government for over two decades, is a longtime ally of Trump’s. She previously made false statements about the 2020 presidential election, resulting in a lawsuit against Fox News that was eventually settled, and Trump pardoned her husband for tax evasion during his first term. The Democratic National Committee called Pirro “yet another unqualified TV personality with a history of putting Trump and violent insurrectionists above the law.” Earlier in her career, Pirro was also the subject of illegal wiretapping probes related to her alleged attempts to bug her then-husband’s boat to find out whether he’d been cheating on her.

– May 29, 2025 – After NOTUS reported that the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” report cited nonexistent studies, leading AI experts claimed that some of the citations may have been generated using artificial intelligence. When asked about the false citations, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt characterized them as “formatting issues” and described the MAHA report as “transformative” and “backed on good science that has never been recognized by the federal government.” Besides the citations for nonexistent studies, some of the footnotes in the MAHA report appeared multiple times, others cited the wrong author, and still others included dead links. Some of the citations included “oaicite” in their URLs, a marker indicating that OpenAI was used. “This is not an evidence-based report, and for all practical purposes, it should be junked at this point,” said Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “It cannot be used for any policymaking. It cannot even be used for any serious discussion because you can’t believe what’s in it.”

– May 29, 2025 – The Washington Post reported that a two-year-old American citizen, Manu Santos, who was deported to Brazil with her parents on February 21, has essentially become stateless. The girl’s parents said they were not given a choice about whether to take their child with them or leave her in the US with her uncle. Because the girl, who was born in Florida, was neither a citizen nor a resident of Brazil, she had to enter the country on a temporary tourism visa. As a result, the child had no legal status and did not have access to routine pediatric checkups; her temporary visa is set to expire in a few weeks, and she remained ineligible for Brazilian citizenship. “What if we need to take her to the doctor?” Manu’s mother wondered.

– May 30, 2025 – The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported that the Trump administration was aware that more than half of the 238 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador in March had no criminal record and had only violated minor immigration laws. After the Venezuelans were deported, multiple news outlets reported that many of the detainees had no criminal records. In response, the Trump administration doubled down, claiming its vetting process was thorough and included crimes committed both inside and outside the US. However, according to government data obtained by The Texas Tribune, ProPublica, and journalists from Venezuela, officials knew at the time that only thirty-two of the detainees had been convicted of US crimes, including nonviolent traffic violations and retail theft, and that only six of the detainees had been convicted of violent US crimes. As part of their investigation, the reporters also found evidence that only twenty of the 238 detainees had been arrested or convicted for foreign offences, though it’s not clear whether the US government already knew this information at the time the men were deported. When reporters questioned the administration about the discrepancies between its public statements and data, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, without providing evidence, repeated past claims: “These individuals categorized as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gang members and more—they just don’t have a rap sheet in the US.”

– May 30, 2025 – The Trump administration ended a $258 million program that was working on an HIV vaccine. “The consortia for HIV/AIDS vaccine development and immunology was reviewed by NIH leadership, which does not support it moving forward,” said a senior official at the NIH. The move was just the latest cut to affect HIV research and prevention. Previously, the NIH cut several grants related to PrEP, and the Trump administration has shut down the HIV-prevention division at the CDC and frozen funds for PEPFAR, which supplied most of the HIV treatment in Africa and developing countries. Although HIV infections have been declining for about fifteen years, the World Health Organization still reported 1.3 million new cases in 2023. “The HIV pandemic will never be ended without a vaccine, so killing research on one will end up killing people,” said John Moore, an HIV researcher.

– May 30, 2025 – Armed ICE agents raided an underground nightclub in Los Angeles, arresting thirty-six Chinese and Taiwanese nationals, as well as a popular Italian restaurant in San Diego, Buona Forchetta, where they arrested several employees. According to Claire Cody, an employee at the restaurant, ICE agents handcuffed all employees present and demanded to see identification. Those unable to produce identification were arrested. After a crowd attempted to block the unmarked ICE vehicles, the agents used flashbang smoke grenades to disperse them. “Ten (federal agents) came into part of our restaurant. And they handcuffed my manager, saying they have a search warrant, and I just started crying because I knew what was happening,” said Cody. “You always see this anywhere else, but then you experience it. And I’m just thinking about my coworkers and thinking about their families, and this is just very unfortunate and very sad. I’m just praying that they’re okay.”

– May 30, 2025 – Three weeks into Sean Combs’s criminal trial, President Trump did not rule out the possibility of pardoning the music mogul, with whom he has had a warm relationship in the past. When asked by a reporter about a potential pardon for Combs, Trump said, “I would certainly look at the facts.” Combs was charged with five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution and could face life in prison if convicted on all counts. Prosecutors allege that Combs forced women to participate in sexual performances with male sex workers over two decades, and two women have testified that Combs raped them. For decades, women have accused Trump of rape and sexual abuse, and in 2023, a court found him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 1996.

– May 30, 2025 – The New York Times reported that Elon Musk was using drugs heavily on the campaign trail last year. According to the article, Musk used Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and so much ketamine that it had begun to impact his bladder, a sign of chronic use. He traveled with a daily pill box that contained approximately twenty pills, including the stimulant Adderall, although it is not known whether he had a prescription for it. Although Musk has previously stated that he was prescribed biweekly ketamine treatments for depression, the Times found that he was using it much more often, sometimes daily, and also mixing it with other drugs. “I really don’t like doing illegal drugs,” Musk previously told his biographer, despite a history of recreational drug use. It is not known whether Musk’s heavy drug usage continued during his tenure at DOGE. Asked about Musk’s alleged drug use, President Trump responded, “I’m not troubled by anything with Elon. I think he’s fantastic. He did a great job.”

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes
April 2025: Atrocities 134-207
by Emily Greenberg and Cliff Mayotte
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
 
Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-spinning number of misdeeds coming from his administration. We called this list a collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s second term.

APRIL 2025
– April 1, 2025 – Princeton University said that the US government had frozen several dozen of its research grants without explanation. According to a Department of Energy spokesperson, the grants were paused “pending the completion of the Department of Education’s investigation into Princeton regarding antisemitic harassment.” The funding freeze came just weeks after Princeton’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, published an opinion essay in The Atlantic criticizing the Trump administration’s threatened funding cuts and demands to Columbia University. Wrote Eisgruber, “The attack on Columbia is a radical threat to scholarly excellence and to America’s leadership in research. Universities and their leaders should speak up and litigate forcefully to protect their rights.” According to Inside Higher Education, approximately $210 million in grants, about half of Princeton’s total grants for the year, were frozen.

– April 1, 2025 – In an interview with Reuters, former Costa Rican president and Nobel laureate Óscar Arias said the US had revoked his visa. The visa revocation came several weeks after Arias posted multiple social media posts critical of the Trump administration. On February 3, Arias compared Trump to a “Roman emperor.” On February 28, he criticized Trump and JD Vance of using “arrogant and humiliating language,” “intimidating words,” and “a series of inappropriate and [sic] threats” in their televised Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “If someone wants to use a reprisal to silence me, well, obviously they’re not going to silence me,” said Arias, who was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an end to conflicts in Central America.

– April 2, 2025 – US District Judge Dale E. Ho dismissed corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams—who spent months currying favor with Trump—but stopped short of dismissing the charges without prejudice, which would have enabled the Justice Department to reinstate the charges at a later date. In his memo to the Southern District of New York, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove had argued that continued prosecution of Adams would interfere with the mayor’s ability to enforce the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. Bove also noted that the order was made “without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.” In his ruling, Judge Ho wrote, “Everything here smacks of a bargain: Dismissal of indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.” He said he had little recourse but to dismiss after the DOJ abandoned the case, but he criticized the Justice Department’s reasoning as “unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep” and rebutted DOJ claims that the prosecution had been political: “There is no evidence—zero—that [Manhattan federal prosecutors] had any improper motives.”

– April 2, 2025 – In a Rose Garden ceremony, President Trump announced sweeping new “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10 percent baseline tariff and significantly higher rates against Japan, China, and the European Union. The following day, the stock market experienced its biggest decline since 2020. The S&P 500 fell 4.84 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.98 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite 5.97 percent. Acknowledging the dramatic stock market declines, Trump compared the tariffs to “an operation, like when a patient gets operated on” and predicted a recovery without evidence: “The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom. And the rest of the world wants to see if there’s any way they can make a deal.” The financial services company JPMorgan said that the tariffs would lead to a recession.

– April 2, 2025 – Following liberal candidate Susan Crawford’s victory in the Wisconsin State Supreme Court election, which was viewed widely as a referendum on Elon Musk, the world’s richest man walked back the results. “I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain,” Musk wrote on his social media company X. He had campaigned vigorously for the conservative candidate Brad Schimel, spending $25 million, including direct payments to voters, and describing the election in existential terms as “one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.” At a Green Bay rally earlier in the week, Musk had handed out two $1 million checks to two individuals who had voted for Schimel. Nevertheless, Crawford won handily by ten percentage points. “Today, Wisconsonites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said during her victory speech. “Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.”

– April 2, 2025 – Millions of dollars in grants to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) were canceled by the Trump administration. NEH provides crucial funding to state humanities councils, museums, historical sites, archives, libraries, educators, media, and schools. Over email, grant recipients were informed that the NEH would be “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the president’s agenda.” Cathy Gorn, executive director of National History Day, one of the programs whose funds were terminated, told The New York Times, “We are in danger of not being able to help this next generation of American citizens understand the nation’s past.”

– April 3, 2025 – The Trump administration laid out a series of demands that Harvard University must meet to avoid losing almost $9 billion in federal grants and contracts. In a letter to Harvard’s president, three federal agencies said Harvard has “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment” and demanded that Harvard ban face masks, clarify its speech policies, make changes to departments that “fuel antisemitic harassment,” ban DEI, adopt “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies, and disclose foreign gifts and contracts. In response to an earlier announcement about the threatened funding cuts, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, wrote in an email that the loss of funds would “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.”

– April 3, 2025 – One day after meeting with far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, Trump fired six national security officials, including the director of the National Security Agency, General Timothy Haugh; Haugh’s civilian deputy, Wendy Noble; and National Security Council Director for Intelligence Brian Walsh. “Always we’re letting go of people,” Trump said on Air Force One. “People that we don’t like or people that we don’t think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to someone else.” During an Oval Office meeting, Loomer presented Trump with printed files of research she had compiled on various officials and urged the president to fire staffers she viewed as insufficiently loyal or who were appointed by former President Joe Biden. Via social media, Loomer accused several of the fired officials of being “disloyal to President Trump” and appeared to confirm her involvement in their removal: “Thank you, President Trump, for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”

– April 3, 2025 – Dr. Mehmet Oz was confirmed as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a 53-45 Senate vote. A celebrity doctor and one-time Republican Senate candidate, Oz has been accused of endorsing products and making recommendations that are not supported by scientific evidence. On The Dr. Oz Show, he suggested apple juice contained dangerous levels of arsenic, promoted green coffee bean extract as a “miracle pill” for weight loss. A 2014 British Medical Journal study found that more than half of Oz’s recommendations on his show either contradicted or were unsupported by scientific research. In 2003, he was banned from presenting research at a conference due to false claims he had made in his research paper abstract. During the pandemic, Oz promoted hydroxychloroquine, a drug to which he had financial ties, as a COVID-19 treatment despite no evidence of its efficacy.

– April 4, 2025 – After a federal judge ordered the federal government to bring back a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller disparaged the judge on social media. “Marxist judge now thinks she’s president of El Salvador,” wrote Miller. Despite having protected legal status and no criminal record in the US, Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland was deported to El Salvador on March 15 in what the Trump administration later admitted was an administrative error. “This was an illegal act,” said Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned no later than April 7, 2025. “Congress said you can’t do it, and you did it anyway.”

– April 4, 2025 – Dozens of international student visas were revoked across the University of California system and at Stanford University. UC-San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said that five UCSD student visas had been rescinded and that a sixth student was “detained at the border, denied entry, and deported to their home country.” “The federal government has not explained the reasons behind these terminations,” said Khosla, who added that the university had received the notifications “without warning.” During a visit to Guyana the previous week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US had revoked approximately three hundred visas, most belonging to students. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,” said Rubio, referring to pro-Palestinian student protesters. “I hope at some point we run out because we have gotten rid of all of them, but we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up.”

– April 4, 2025 – As President Trump golfed in Florida, over 1,400 anti-Trump “Hands Off Rallies” involving an estimated one million people took place across all fifty states. The organizers called for “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration”; “an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on”; and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.” In response, the White House released a statement defending the president and attacking Democrats: “President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.” In a segment that aired two days later on Fox News, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also referred to the protesters as “far-left lunatics” and called Democrats the “party of crazy.”

– April 4, 2025 – An unvaccinated eight-year-old Texas girl with no underlying health 
conditions died from measles. Following the death of another unvaccinated Texas child 
with no underlying health conditions on February 25, it was the second such US death 
since 2015 and the second such US death of a child since 2003. Another unvaccinated 
person died on March 6 after testing positive for measles, though officials have not 
yet confirmed the cause of death. As of April 6, 480 measles cases were reported in 
West Texas, 54 in New Mexico, and 10 in Oklahoma. In an opinion essay for Fox News 
that was published in early March, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert 
Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, stopped short of explicitly recommending 
universal MMR vaccination, calling the decision to vaccinate a “personal” choice. He 
also advocated for vitamin A treatment, which experts have recommended against using 
in most measles cases. More recently, Kennedy emphasized untested measles treatments 
like cod liver oil and hired a discredited vaccine skeptic to research long-debunked 
links between vaccines and autism.

– April 4, 2025 – Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who expressed frustration with the government’s deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was placed on indefinite leave. Garcia, a Maryland man with protected legal status, was deported in March due to what the government has described as an “administrative error.” In court, Reuveni said that Abrego Garcia “should not have been removed” and added that he did not know why Abrego Garcia was arrested. “I am also frustrated that I have no answers for you on a lot of these questions,” said Reuveni. When asked why the government couldn’t bring Abrego Garcia back, Reuveni responded, “I will say for the court’s awareness that when this case landed on my desk, the first thing I did was ask my client the same question. I have not yet received a satisfactory answer.”

– April 6, 2025 – Trump hosted events that attracted hundreds of donors to his Palm Beach club and resort. Guests gathered at Mar-a Lago for The American Patriots Gala, which featured Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump’s Doral Club also hosted a golf tournament sponsored by the Saudi-backed league LIV Golf. All 643 rooms at the club were full, including the $13,000-per-night Presidential Suite. Trump boasted on social media, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH, RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE.” The day before the events, Trump used his trademark Sharpie pen to announce new global tariffs that erased $5 trillion in market value from S&P 500 companies. Versions of the pen were available at Mar-a-Lago for three dollars.

– April 6, 2025 – Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders. He accused the South Sudanese government of “taking advantage of the United States,” adding, “every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country seeks to remove them.” Rubio also said the US would “prevent further issuance to prevent entry into the United States by South Sudanese passport holders.” South Sudan nationals were granted “temporary protected status” (TPS) by the Obama and Biden administrations. TPS is granted to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary” conditions. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged international leaders to prevent South Sudan from falling “over the abyss” into another civil war.

– April 7, 2025 – Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation in drinking water nationwide. Kennedy said he would assemble a task force to study the issue and make new recommendations. In March 2025, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in drinking water—against the advice of the American Dental Association. Kennedy praised Utah for becoming “the leader in making America healthy again.” Kennedy’s announcement coincided with the elimination of the twenty-person Division of Oral Health. The CDC has stated that community water fluoridation is one of ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century.

– April 7, 2025 – US Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO’S military committee, was fired by the Trump administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth removed Chatfield, “due to a lack of confidence in her ability to lead.” Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation. Of the ten firings of military officers that have taken place during Trump’s second term, five of them were women. In the US military, women make up seventeen percent of the total force.

– April 8, 2025 – Federal District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the White House to restore the Associated Press’s (AP) full access to President Trump. The judge said that banning the news outlet violated the First Amendment. His opinion stated, “The Constitution requires no less.” Trump barred AP reporters from presidential press events because of their refusal to acknowledge Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. In March 2024, AP reporter Josh Boak grilled White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt on the difference between taxes and tariffs. “I think it’s insulting that you’re trying to test my knowledge of economics,” Leavitt said. “I now regret giving a question to the Associated Press.”

– April 9, 2025 – Trump unexpectedly reversed course on steep global tariffs on nearly sixty countries just hours before he put them in place. Trump said he authorized a ninety-day pause in which countries would face “a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff” of 10 percent. Trump did not extend the pause to China. He raised China’s tariffs to a hefty 125 percent. China retaliated by raising levies on American goods to 84 percent. Before the announcement, Trump’s tariffs had wreaked havoc on markets and sparked fears of a recession. “Over the last few days, it looked pretty glum,” Trump said, “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy.” According to the Center for American Progress, the typical American household can now expect to pay an average of $4,600 annually because of Trump’s tariffs.

– April 9, 2025 – Trump faced accusations of market manipulation hours before he paused US global tariffs. At 9:37 a.m., Trump posted on Truth Social, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,” Several hours later, he announced the ninety-day tariff pause, which created a surge in market shares. When questioned about the timing of his decision, Trump said, “I would say this morning. Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it. Fairly early this morning.” Kathleen Clark, a government ethics law expert at Washington University School of Law said, “He’s sending the message that he can effectively and with impunity manipulate the market. As in: Watch this space for future stock tips.”

– April 9, 2025 – The Supreme Court instructed the Trump administration to take steps to bring back Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. The court rejected the administration’s emergency appeal and partially endorsed US District Court Judge Paula Xinis’s order that required the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return” of Mr. Abrego Garcia. The administration conceded that it made a mistake in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, calling it an administrative error. Murray Osario, an attorney representing Abrego Garcia, called the ruling an “overdue first step” that “does nothing to address the government’s obligation to return him safely and immediately to the United States.”

– April 11, 2025 – Trump administration officials recommended deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The proposal included ending "all funding for climate, weather, and ocean Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.” Officials also recommended eliminating the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Office (OAR). The OAR had provided a variety of scientific services, including early warning systems for natural disasters, science education for K-12 students, and the study of the rapidly warming Arctic. The NOAA recommendation came on the heels of the removal of mentions of climate change from federal websites. House Science Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren said she will “do everything [she] can to stand in the way of this idiotic plan.”

– April 11, 2025 – A Louisiana immigration judge ruled that Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, could be deported. Judge Jamee E. Comans said at the hearing that the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.” Khalil recalled Judge Comans saying at a hearing earlier in the week that “there’s nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.” In response to the ruling, Khalil said, “Clearly, what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to the court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”

– April 12, 2025 – Trump continued to escalate the trade war with China, rattling investors, businesses, and consumers. Beijing raised tariffs on US imports to 125 percent after the White House clarified that Chinese imports now face tariffs of 145 percent. US businesses that relied on products from China were faced with halted shipments. In response to the backlash, Trump announced he would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs. Trump proclaimed on Truth Social, “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also tried to allay fears. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing,” she said. “This is a proven economic formula.” Larry Fink, CEO of mega-investment firm BlackRock, was not convinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now.”

– April 13, 2025 – In a memo shared with the Washington Post, State Department officials revealed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio lacked the evidence for revoking the visa of Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk. Yet on March 25, ICE agents detained her anyway. The memo questioned the accusations made by the Trump administration that Ozturk “engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor U.S. attorneys provided evidence to support their claim, a search of U.S. government databases on Ozturk did not reveal any terrorist-related and antisemitc activity. During a hearing in Vermont, Jesse Rossman, Ozturk’s attorney, said, “There is not discretion, even in immigration law, for the government to violate the Constitution.”

– April 13, 2025 – Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that ten more immigrants had been deported to El Salvador. “Last night, another ten criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio posted on social media, without providing any evidence of the deported men’s gang affiliations or that they had been charged with a crime. The Trump administration began deporting immigrants to the notorious Salvadoran prison CECOT in March without due process and based on little more than their tattoos and clothing.

– April 13, 2025 – When asked on Air Force One about claims of human rights abuses at CECOT, the notorious Salvadoran prison where the Trump administration has sent deportees, President Trump responded, “I don’t see it.” CECOT does not allow visitation, recreation, or education, and 65-70 inmates are crammed into each cell. Last year, the human rights organization Cristosal reported that at least 261 people had died in El Salvador’s prisons during a gang crackdown and cited additional cases of abuse, torture, and lack of medical attention. “They only have about half an hour outside of their windowless cells to be outside in a hallway of the prison,” said Margaret Cargioli, a lawyer for Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “They are overcrowded within each of the cells, and they’re sleeping on metal.” The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said they were not aware of any detainees who had ever been released from CECOT.

– April 14, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Trump, El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele told reporters that he would not aid in the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man with protect status who was “accidentally” deported in March by ICE and sent to an El Salvadoran terrorist confinement center. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Garcia, but Attorney General Pam Bondi said the ruling meant that they could only assist in his return if the El Salvadoran government agreed to it. “How can I return [Garcia] to the United States? Like, if I smuggle him into the United States?” President Bukele said, with Trump at his side. “Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous.” Stephen Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, told the New York Times that Garcia’s deportation amounted to a “rule-of-law crisis.” “If the government can do it to Abrego Garcia,” he said, “they can do it to anybody.”

– April 14, 2025 – The Trump administration froze over $2 billion in grants to Harvard University after the school announced it would not comply with the federal government’s demands. In March, Trump’s antisemitism task force placed $9 billion, most of it dedicated to health research and hospital funding, on hold while they investigated the nation’s oldest university’s efforts to stop antisemitism on campus and reviewed its policies around student and faculty protests. On April 11, members of the task force sent a letter to Harvard saying it must change its admissions and hiring policies, as well as end all its DEI programs. 
In an open letter, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber explained why the school would not agree to the Trump administatrion’s orders, “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.” Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement, condemning her alma mater’s decision. “Harvard University has rightfully earned its place as the epitome of the moral and academic rot in higher education,” she wrote. “It is time to totally cut off U.S. taxpayer funding to this institution that has failed to live up to its founding motto, Veritas.” The money pulled back by the government was to be used for research on HIV, tuberculosis, and traumatic brain injuries.

– April 14, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, President Trump expressed enthusiasm yet again for deporting US citizens convicted of violent crimes to El Salvador. “Homegrown criminals are next. I said homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You’ve gotta build about five more places,” Trump told Bukele, in an exchange that was livestreamed. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters. I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country.” Although Trump said that Attorney General Pam Bondi was studying the matter, legal experts said there was nothing to look into: “It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.

– April 14, 2025 – Stephen Miller, US Homeland Security advisor and White House deputy chief of staff, contradicted Department of Justice documents acknowledging that the Trump administration had made “an administrative error” in deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had protected legal status, to El Salvador. “Nobody was mistakenly deported anywhere,” Miller told reporters outside the White House. “That’s a big mistake that all of you, most of you, have gotten wrong. No one was mistakenly sent anywhere. The only mistake that was made is a lawyer put an incorrect line in a legal filing that’s since been relieved… [Abrego Garcia] is El Salvadorian. He is an illegal alien. He was deported to El Salvador.” On Fox News, Miller doubled down, arguing that Abrego Garcia was not mistakenly deported and stating without evidence that he was a member of MS-13. Mr. Abrego Garcia has denied being a member of any gang, and he has not been convicted of any crime.

– April 14, 2025 – State Department official Pete Marocco, who oversaw the dismantling of USAID, stepped down afterless than three months on the job. Marocco, who fired thousands of USAID staffers and supported plans to cancel 83 percent of USAID programs, had previously described USAID as “a money laundering scheme” and accused the agency of advancing LGBTQ causes in developing countries and antiauthoritarian movements in former Soviet states. Senior USAID officials previously warned Trump administration officials that the closure of USAID would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

– April 14, 2025 – Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident, was arrested by immigration 
officials after arriving for an appointment to take his citizenship test, the final step in 
the process of becoming a citizen. A Palestinian student at Columbia University who has 
lived in the US for ten years, Mahdawi participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at 
Columbia, though he stepped back from organizing in March 2024. In a memo, Secretary of 
State Marco Rubio accused Mahdawi—without evidence—of undermining the Middle East peace 
process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment, stating that Mahdawi had “engaged in 
threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders.” 
However, statements from Mahdawi’s friends and Mahdawi’s own previous statements 
contradict Rubio’s assertions. “[Mahdawi’s] willingness to actually hear and actively 
learn and understand the Israeli experience—I mean, I’ve never met anyone who so 
quickly was willing to take feedback,” said Mikey Baratz, an Israeli who recently 
graduated from Columbia. In a December 2023 interview about his childhood experience 
seeing his friend killed by an Israeli soldier, Mahdawi said he wanted a peaceful 
end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: “My motivation comes out of love now, not 
out of anger, not out of hate.”

– April 15, 2025 – In an interview on Fox News, border czar Tom Homan said he would deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia again if he were returned to the US, openly defying court orders. “Now, if somehow he comes back and that happens, he’s going to be detained and removed again. He’s an MS-13 gang member based on our intelligence and El Salvador’s intelligence,” said Homan without providing details or evidence to support his claims. Abrego Garcia, who has protected legal status, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March in what the Trump administration has admitted was “an administrative error.” The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego’s return, but so far, little has been done.

– April 15, 2025 – One day after the Trump administration froze $2 billion in grants to Harvard University for rejecting its policy demands, President Trump threatened the school’s tax-exempt status on Truth Social: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Almost all colleges and universities have tax-exempt status, and federal law prohibits the executive branch from “directly or indirectly” ordering the IRS to conduct specific tax investigations. “Selective prosecution of your political adversaries through the tax system is the stuff of dictatorship. This is unconscionable and wrong but a continuation of trends we have seen in President Trump’s approach both to universities and to tax enforcement,” said Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard.

– April 16, 2025 – Following Trump’s executive order “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” in February and months of escalating threats, the Trump administration sued Maine for refusing to ban transgender athletes from women’s sports. The lawsuit accused Maine of violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, and called for a compensation program for “female athletes who have been denied equal athletic opportunities.” “This is about sports,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “This is also about these women’s personal safety.” Maine Governor Janet Mills countered: “This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed. It is about states’ rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.” Transgender people make up less than .002 percent of US college athletes, and trans women have been competing in women’s sports for decades.

– April 16, 2025 – Disregarding established scientific research, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that autism was preventable and that an increase in autism cases was caused solely by environmental factors. “Genes don’t cause epidemics. You need an environmental toxin,” Kennedy said. Researchers maintain that the increase in autism cases was instead due to better screening, awareness, and access, as well as broader definitions of autism and more parents having children later in life. Though environmental factors may possibly contribute to whether a child develops autism, there is no evidence to suggest that autism is preventable, and scientists have known since the 1970s that genes play a role. “Autism is not an infectious disease. So there aren’t preventative measures that we can take,” said Dr. Joshua Anbar, a professor at Arizona State University who collected data for the CDC report on autism showing increased rates. Added Dr. Catherine Lord, a psychologist and autism researcher, “We know there is a clear genetic contribution. That is not in question.” Kennedy has also repeatedly promoted false theories that vaccines cause autism.

– April 16, 2025 – The Trump administration moved to redefine what it means to “harm” a protected species under the Endangered Species Act. According to the Endangered Species Act, the definition of “harm” includes “significant habitat modification or degradation,” a definition upheld by a 1995 Supreme Court ruling. The Trump administration proposal seeks to narrow the definition of “harm” so that only taking direct action to kill or injure a species would qualify, a move that would make it significantly easier to log, build, or drill for oil. “What they’re proposing will just fundamentally upend how we’ve been protecting endangered species in this country,” said Noah Greenwald, codirector of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. Habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction in the US.

– April 16, 2025 – Two days after the Trump administration froze $2 billion in grants to Harvard University and one day after President Trump threatened the school’s tax-exempt status on social media, the Department of Homeland Security canceled another $2.7 million in grants to Harvard and threatened to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students. In a letter sent to Harvard, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard provide detailed records on foreign student visa holders’ “known illegal” and “known dangerous or violent” activities by April 30, 2025, or the school would lose its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification. “Harvard bending the knee to antisemitism—driven by its spineless leadership—fuels a cesspool of extremist riots and threatens our national security,” Noem said in a press statement. A Harvard spokeswoman said the school was aware of Noem’s letter, which she said “followed on the heels of our statement that Harvard will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”

– April 17, 2025 – Following a deadly shooting at Florida State University that left two dead and six injured, President Trump said he would not support stricter gun control measures. “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” Trump told reporters. “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment, among many other things, and I will always protect the Second Amendment.” One FSU student who survived the shooting, Robbie Alhadeff, previously lost his sister Alyssa in the 2018 Parkland High School massacre. “A lot of the people I’m friends with are from Parkland, and a lot of them go to FSU. This is the second time it’s happened—and no one I know wants to go back to school,” said Alhadeff. In February, Trump signed an executive order directing the attorney general to withdraw several Biden administration gun regulations.

– April 17, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, President Trump told reporters that he had the power to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who had recently warned that Trump’s tariffs would likely lead to significant economic damage. “Oh, he’ll leave. If I ask him to, he’ll be out of there,” Trump said. “I don’t think he’s doing the job. He’s too late, always too late. Little slow, and I’m not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast.” 
Earlier in the day, Trump had criticized Powell and called for his removal in a social media post riddled with inaccurate and misleading information: “The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, ‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’ Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” No Federal Reserve chair has ever been fired by a president, and the Federal Reserve Act states that board members may only be removed “for cause,” which has historically been interpreted as misconduct or incapacity.

– April 17, 2025 – At the direction of DOGE, three-quarters of AmeriCorps staff members were placed on administrative leave. Established in 1993 under a different name, AmeriCorps was designed as a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Its young volunteers work on community service projects related to disaster services, environmental stewardship, education, and veterans’ affairs, among others. The layoffs included employees who work for a national disaster response program and may affect work in areas impacted by Hurricane Helene. The following day, California Governor Gavin Newsom decried the layoffs and announced that California would sue to stop the dismantling of AmeriCorps: “We’ve gone from the New Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society to a federal government that gives a middle finger to volunteers serving their fellow Americans.”

– April 17, 2025 – The Trump administration sent termination notices to 90 percent of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency that supervises financial institutions and enforces federal consumer protection laws. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has returned $21 billion to defrauded consumers since its founding in 2011. The layoffs are part of the administration’s larger attempts to dismantle the CFPB, which has been criticized by prominent Trump donors, including Elon Musk, as a barrier to their business interests. In February, Elon Musk’s X announced a deal with Visa to offer mobile payment services, which would be regulated by the CFPB. “The fact that Musk is now engaged in payment businesses that would be regulated by the CFPB at the same time he’s trying to tear down the CFPB puts in sharp relief the conflicts of interest here and how much this disserves the general public,” said Richard Cordray, a former director of the CFPB. “The whole situation is rife with conflicts of interest.”

– April 17, 2025 – President Trump signed two executive orders aimed at the commercial fishing industry. The first, “Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific,” opened the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, one of the world’s largest ocean reserves, to commercial fishing; the second, “Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness,” ordered the Commerce Department to loosen regulations on the commercial fishing industry. While some fishermen celebrated the move, environmentalists argued that opening the Pacific Islands National Monument to commercial fishing would harm the area’s ecosystem and endanger marine life. In response, Angelo Villagomez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said that opening up marine monuments to industrial fishing “sets a dangerous precedent that our public lands and waters are for sale to the highest bidder.”

– April 18, 2025 – Escalating its crackdown on Harvard University, the Trump administration accused Harvard of failing to report large foreign donations. In a letter to the university’s president, the Department of Education demanded that Harvard provide a list of all foreign donors, turn over all records of foreign donor communication dating back to 2020, and provide details on foreigners who had spent time at Harvard, dating back to 2010. “Today’s records request is the Trump administration’s first step to ensure Harvard is not being manipulated by, or doing the bidding of, foreign entities,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, without providing any evidence to support her department’s accusations against Harvard. Pushing back against the accusations, Harvard responded that it had filed such reports for decades “as part of its ongoing compliance with the law”:https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-demands-harvards-foreign-funding-records-acc11947 “As is required, Harvard’s reports include information on gifts and contracts from foreign sources exceeding $250K annually. This includes contracts to provide executive education, other training, and academic publications.”

– April 19, 2025 – Vice President JD Vance attempted to airbrush his meeting with Vatican officials after Pope Francis did not attend, instead sending his deputy, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, to reportedly lecture Vance about compassion. “There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions, and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the Vatican said in a statement. In response, Vance’s office released photos of the vice president smiling and laughing with Vatican officials and walking through the Vatican with his children. “The Vice President and Cardinal Parolin discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump’s commitment to restoring world peace,” Vance’s office said. 
In February, Pope Francis criticized the Trump administration’s deportation policies and urged Catholics to reject anti-immigrant narratives. Without mentioning Vance by name, the pope rebuked the vice president’s invocation of ordo amoris, which Vance had characterized as a hierarchy of duties prioritizing one’s family and community over the rest of the world, to defend the administration’s deportations: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.” In his final public statement on Easter Sunday, Pope Francis reiterated the importance of rejecting xenophobia: “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants! On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those different from ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life, and ideas! For all of us are children of God!” Hours later, Pope Francis died of a stroke and cardiovascular arrest.

– April 19, 2025 – Two weeks after hundreds of thousands marched against the Trump administration in 1,400 “Hands Off!” rallies across the country, a new wave of “50501” anti-Trump protests were held nationwide to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolution. According to the protest’s organizers, over three million people attended the 50501 protests. While some protesters gathered outside the White House, Trump was at his golf course.

– April 20, 2025 – In an Easter post on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at his enemies and repeated his debunked claims about the 2020 election. His post included “Radical Left Lunatics,” “WEAK and INCOMPETENT judges,” and “Sleepy Joe Biden.” Trump declared, “He was, by far, our WORST and most Incompetent President—But to him, and to the person that ran and manipulated the Auto Pen (perhaps our REAL President!), and to all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!” Republicans Against Trump, a group of GOP supporters who don’t back Trump, wrote in an X post, “Ah yes, the true spirit of Easter: rage-posting about your political enemies.”

– April 21, 2025 – Trump announced that undocumented immigrants should not be entitled to trials and insisted that his administration should be allowed to deport them without appearing before a judge. “I hope we get cooperation from the courts. We have thousands of people that are ready to go out and you can’t have a trial for all these people.” Trump added, “A judge can’t say, ‘No, you have to have a trial.’ The trial is going to take two years. We’re going to have a very dangerous country if we’re not allowed to do what we’re entitled to do.” In response to Trump’s statements, Representative Jonathan L. Jackson, Democrat of Illinois, wrote on social media, “‘We can’t give everyone a trial’—excuse me, what?! That’s straight-up #dictator talk… If you want to shred the Constitution, just say so.”

– April 21, 2025 – The president continued his attacks against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump called Powell “a major loser” and demanded that the Central Bank lower its key interest rate to boost the economy. Trump stated that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually no inflation.” Food prices jumped in January and March, and overall inflation remained above the Fed’s 2 percent target. After Trump’s attack on Powell, the Dow dropped by more than 1,000 points, and the broad S&P 500 stock index tumbled nearly 3 percent. The dollar fell to its lowest level in three years.

– April 21, 2025 – The White House expressed support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after The New York Times reported that he shared sensitive military information in another Signal chat. The chat included Hegseth’s wife and brother. Trump said, “It’s just fake news. They just bring up stories. I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “This is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement.” In an interview with Politico, Republican Representative and former Air Force General Don Bacon said, “Russia and China are all over his phone, and for him to be putting secret stuff on his phone is not right… He’s acting like he’s above the law—and that shows an amateur person.”

– April 22, 2025 – A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America (VOA), the government-funded broadcaster. Trump and his Republican allies had accused VOA of having a “leftist bias” and “failing to project pro-American values.” In defending VOA’s mission, plaintiff attorneys wrote, “That simple mission is a powerful one for those living across the globe without access to a free press and without the ability to otherwise discern what is truly happening.” Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated the administration’s move to decimate the agency was “arbitrary” and “capricious.” He went on to say, “Not only is there an absence of ‘reasoned analysis’ from the defendants; there is an absence of any analysis whatsoever.”

– April 22, 2025 – Trump announced that Elon Musk would step back from his role as director of DOGE. The move corresponded with a steep decline in Tesla’s profits. Trump supported Musk’s move and said, “He saved us a lot of money.” Without providing details, Musk said he had saved taxpayers $150 billion. The figure was 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save. Musk’s and DOGE’s miscalculations stemmed from the financial costs of their chainsaw for bureaucracy policy. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, used budget figures to produce a rough estimate that firings, rehirings, lost productivity, and paid leave of thousands of workers would cost upward of $135 billion.

– April 23, 2025 – Trump demanded that Ukraine agree to a proposal that would grant Russia all the Crimean territory it has gained in the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded, “There is nothing to talk about. It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people.” On social media, Trump said that Zelenskyy was being “inflammatory” and “would only prolong the killing field.” He told reporters at the White House that the deal was on the verge of acceptance by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump added, “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it’s harder.” Russia overtook the Crimean Peninsula by force in 2014. The peninsula is roughly the size of the US state of Maryland.

– April 24, 2025 – A federal judge paused a key section of Trump’s executive order that proposed sweeping changes to voting and elections. Trump’s March 24 order stated that election fraud was rampant. “This will end it, hopefully,” he said when signing it. Past audits have proven election fraud to be very rare. The order instructed the independent Election Assistance Commission to require that applicants prove US citizenship before they can be registered to vote. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with voting rights groups and Democrats, saying that the Constitution gives the power to regulate federal elections to states and Congress—not the president. During the 2024 election, Trump pushed a baseless narrative that large numbers of noncitizens were poised to vote and swing the election for Democrats.

– April 25, 2025 – The FBI arrested Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan and charged her in federal court for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest. The arrest escalated the Trump administration’s focus on judges’ conduct related to immigration enforcement. FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X: “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject—an illegal alien—to evade arrest.” He said that agents arrested Ruiz after he was “chased down.” Patel added that “the judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.” On Truth Social, Trump shared an image of the judge found on her Facebook page by the right-wing blogger Libs of TikTok. The image showed Dugan on the bench wearing a KN95 face mask and displaying the Ukrainian national symbol of a trident.

– April 25, 2025 – In a possible violation of Justice Department policy, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media of Judge Hannah Dugan’s perp walk with the caption, “No one is above the law.” According to the DOJ’s Confidentiality and Media Contacts Policy, DOJ personnel are not permitted to “voluntarily disclose a photograph of a defendant unless it serves a law enforcement function or unless the photograph is already part of the public record.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who implemented the policy during the Obama administration, said Patel’s post violated the policy. “Whatever the issues with what the judge did, they’re trying to maximize intimidation.”

– April 25, 2025 – A two-year-old US citizen was deported to Honduras with her pregnant mother and eleven-year-old sister despite an emergency petition filed by the child’s father. US District Court Judge Terry A. Doughty called the deportation “illegal and unconstitutional” and stated that he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process.” The two-year-old child, referred to in court papers as V. M. L., had accompanied her mother and sister to an immigration appointment in New Orleans, where the three were subsequently detained by ICE. After the child’s mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, was scheduled for an expedited removal, Justice Department lawyers claimed in a filing that Lopez Villela told ICE that she wanted to retain custody of V. M. L. and to take the child with her to Honduras. The child’s father disputed this narrative, and Lopez Villela’s consent has not been independently verified. According to the ACLU, Lopez Villela was not allowed to speak with lawyers and was only permitted to speak with her husband for less than a minute before she was deported. ICE did not coordinate any continuity of prenatal care or medical oversight for Lopez Villela.

 – April 25, 2025 – A four-year-old US citizen and seven-year-old US citizen were deported with their mother to Honduras. The family did not have the opportunity to speak with lawyers before they were deported, according to the National Immigration Project. Lawyers for the family said the mother was not given an option to leave the children in the United States and that the four-year-old boy, who has a rare form of late-stage cancer, did not have access to his medications or doctors while in custody. “Deporting U.S. citizen children is illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral,” said Erin Herbert, a lawyer with Ware Immigration. “The speed, brutality, and clandestine manner in which these children were deported is beyond unconscionable, and every official responsible for it should be held accountable.”

– April 26, 2025 – Trump traveled to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis. Before leaving, he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The topic of their conversation was Russia’s killing of civilians earlier in the week. Following the meeting, Trump posted on Truth Social that there was “no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” At the funeral, the president broke the Vatican’s dress code by wearing a blue suit. He was also seen checking his phone and chewing gum. Trump spent only fourteen hours in Rome. He told aides that he wanted to return to his golf resort in New Jersey by the end of the day.

– April 27, 2025 – A CNN poll showed that Trump’s approval ratings had plummeted as he approached the hundred-day mark of his presidency. Only 41 percent of respondents approved of his job performance—the lowest any president has polled at the one hundred-day mark in seven decades. Forty-five percent said they strongly disapproved of Trump’s handling of the presidency, and just 40 percent said they have a favorable view of the president. Trump lost support from women, Hispanic Americans, and political independents. Since March 2025, when Trump’s tariff plan led to declines in the stock market, the president’s approval ratings on economic issues fell significantly, including a 9 percent drop on inflation and a 4 percent drop on tariffs. Trump dismissed the bad polling and suggested that new organizations that published them should be investigated for “election fraud.”

– April 28, 2025 – President Trump signed two executive orders targeting sanctuary cities, immigrants, and officials accused of “obstructing criminal or immigration law enforcement.” The first order, “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens,” directed the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of so-called sanctuary cities and to pursue “all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures”; the order also told federal agencies to stop enforcing state and local laws that allow undocumented immigrants to receive in-state tuition benefits in higher education. The second order, “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens,” directed the Trump administration to provide additional resources to law enforcement, including legal resources to cops accused of wrongdoing, modifications to existing restraints such as federal consent decrees, and military equipment to local law enforcement; the order also instructs law enforcement to pursue legal action against state or local officials accused of “obstructing criminal or immigration law enforcement.” “These orders have no legal basis and are another example of President Trump’s relentless campaign to attack the integrity of our legal system and separation of powers by targeting judges, lawyers, and other officials who refuse to comply with his extreme agenda,” said Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division.

– April 28, 2025 – As part of the Trump administration’s efforts to promote its immigration crackdown, one hundred mug-shot-style posters of arrested immigrants were erected on the White House lawn. The posters included the words ARRESTED and ILLEGAL ALIEN as well as text specifying the alleged crimes of those depicted. Although the posters did not include the immigrants’ names, they were identified in a White House press release. A White House social media account posted a video panning across the posters as Michael Bublé’s “Feeling Good” played in the background. “Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” said border czar Tom Homan. “Every sick person we take off the street, especially child rapists, makes this country safer.” According to ICE’s own latest data, 46 percent of detainees in mid-April had no criminal record.

– April 28, 2025 – In an interview with The Atlantic, President Trump bragged about how much fun he’s having during his second presidency. When asked whether his second term felt different than his first, Trump said, “The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys. And the second time, I run the country and the world.” Later, he acknowledged, “I’m having a lot of fun, considering what I do. You know, what I do is such serious stuff.” Added Brian Ballard, a lobbyist and Trump ally: “The first time, the first weeks, it was just ‘Let’s blow this place up.’ This time, he’s blowing it up with a twinkle in his eye.”

– April 29, 2025 – During an interview with ABC News’ Terry Moran, President Trump incorrectly stated that Kilmar Abrego Garcia—the Maryland man with protected legal status who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported due to an “administrative error”—had “MS-13” tattooed on his knuckles. The president appeared to be referring to an altered photo of Abrego Garcia’s hand that he had posted to social media the previous week. The photo showed four of Garcia’s fingers with tattoos of a leaf, a face, a cross, and a skull. Above the tattoos, the term “MS13” was digitally superimposed as a caption. When Moran told Trump that the letters were photoshopped, Trump snapped, “Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes, he does,’ and, you know, go on to something else.”

– April 29, 2025 – Trump marked one hundred days in office by railing against immigrants and attacking his opponents during a Michigan rally. “We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first hundred days of any administration in the history of our country,” Trump said, surrounded by screens reading “100 Days of Greatness.” During his ninety-minute speech, Trump repeated lies about the 2020 election being stolen, mocked how Joe Biden looked in a bathing suit, and bragged about his immigration crackdown. “Removing the invaders is not just a campaign pledge, it’s my solemn duty as commander-in-chief,” Trump said. The crowd cheered as Trump played a video of deportees arriving at the notorious El Salvador prison, CECOT, and having their heads shaved. The Daily Beast declared Trump’s first one hundred days the “worst” in history.

– April 29, 2025 – Wired reported that Christopher Sweet, a college junior, was tasked with using AI to propose rewrites to Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations for DOGE. In an email sent to HUD employees, Sweet was introduced as a student at the University of Chicago, studying economics and data science. His role has involved reviewing HUD regulations, comparing them to existing laws, and identifying areas where the rules could be relaxed or eliminated. As the lead on the AI deregulation project, Sweet was given access to HUD’s data repository on public housing and its enterprise income verification systems. He had no previous government experience.

– April 29, 2025 – In a social media post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted about cutting the Women, Peace, and Security program, which encourages more women to play active roles in national security issues: “This morning, I proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security’ (WPS) program inside the @DeprtofDefense. WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops—distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING….GOOD RIDDANCE WPS!” Two Trump cabinet members—Secretary of State Marco Rubio and DHS Secretary Kristi L. Noem—previously cosponsored the bill establishing the program, which Trump himself signed into law in 2017. Women remain underrepresented in national security roles.

– April 30, 2025 – The Commerce Department reported that the US economy had its worst quarter since 2022. GDP fell to an annualized rate of -0.3 percent, a sharp drop from the fourth quarter’s 2.4 percent rate, and the stock market declined after the announcement. Peter Navarro, special counselor to the president, attempted to spin the GDP report as “very positive news for America,” and President Trump, in a social media post, blamed the weak economic numbers on former president Biden: “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.” Economists have instead blamed the weak numbers on the chaos and uncertainty created in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs.

– April 30, 2025 – The Trump administration announced that it had signed a mineral deal with Ukraine that will give the US a share in future revenues from Ukraine’s mineral reserves; the deal did not include explicit security guarantees for Ukraine. “This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.” At a CPAC conference several months ago, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to pay the US back for military aid. “I want them to give us something for all the money we put up. So we’re asking for rare earth and oil—anything we can get!” said Trump. “We’re going to get our money back because it’s not fair.” Two days after announcing the minerals deal, the State Department said it was stepping back from mediating the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

– April 30, 2025 – On Trump’s 101st day in office, The New York Times published an article in which historians claimed many of Trump’s actions were unprecedented. The thirty-five historians categorized six of Trump’s actions as having “no clear historical precedent”: invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants; dismantling USAID; renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”; withholding federal funding from universities; declaring a “national energy emergency”; and issuing more than one hundred executive orders in his first one hundred days. The historians also categorized five of Trump’s actions as having “no precedent in the modern era”: ignoring a federal judge’s order; asserting broad power over independent federal agencies; ordering or calling for an end to birthright citizenship; repeatedly stating a desire to acquire another nation’s sovereign land; and imposing universal tariffs.

– April 30, 2025 – Just one day before Mike Waltz was ousted as National Security Advisor, a Reuters photographer captured a photo of him using a modified version of Signal during a cabinet meeting. The photo showed that Waltz was communicating via Signal with Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Although the version of Signal that Waltz was using retains copies of messages to comply with government record preservation regulations, it is not approved for sensitive government communications. In March, Waltz came under fire after he accidentally included a journalist on a Signal group chat in which war plans were discussed.

– April 30, 2025 – During a televised Cabinet meeting, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Donald Trump had saved the lives of 258 million Americans, or three-quarters of the population. “Since you have been in office, President Trump, your DOJ agencies have seized more than 22 million fentanyl pills—3,400 kilos of fentanyl… which saved—are you ready for this, media?—258 million lives,” said Bondi. Just two days earlier, on Fentanyl Awareness Day, Bondi had posted on social media that Trump had saved 119 million lives. According to experts, fentanyl seizures show only how much fentanyl didn’t make it into the US, and the relationship between fentanyl entering the US and overdose deaths is less clear. “Bondi’s statements demonstrate profound ignorance about fentanyl and interdiction,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction. He added, “119 million Americans do not even use fentanyl, and to risk an overdose requires intentional ingestion of fentanyl or another illicit drug contaminated with fentanyl. Fentanyl overdose is not a risk for people who do not use drugs.” In 2024, opioid overdose deaths declined in the US for the first time in six years, which many have attributed to the wider availability of Narcan; a draft budget proposal showed that the Trump administration planned to eliminate a $56 million Narcan program.

– April 30, 2025 – Two weeks before President Trump’s planned visit to the Middle East, the Trump Organization agreed to a new Middle East golf course and real estate deal involving Qatari Diar, a government-owned firm. The Qatari golf course is only the latest example of Trump family members partnering with a foreign government. In Oman, the Trump Organization is building hotels and golf projects on government-owned land; other Trump Organization real estate deals involve Serbia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and the Emirates. “It’s extremely troubling,” said Zephyr Teachout, a law professor who previously sued Trump for taking improper financial payments from foreign governments. “The Qatari government, military, and trade decisions are now unavoidably a part of the broader private negotiation over a real estate deal.”

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes
April 2025: Atrocities 134-207
by Emily Greenberg and Cliff Mayotte
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-spinning number of misdeeds coming from his administration. We called this list a collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s second term.

APRIL 2025
– April 1, 2025 – Princeton University said that the US government had frozen several dozen of its research grants without explanation. According to a Department of Energy spokesperson, the grants were paused “pending the completion of the Department of Education’s investigation into Princeton regarding antisemitic harassment.” The funding freeze came just weeks after Princeton’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, published an opinion essay in The Atlantic criticizing the Trump administration’s threatened funding cuts and demands to Columbia University. Wrote Eisgruber, “The attack on Columbia is a radical threat to scholarly excellence and to America’s leadership in research. Universities and their leaders should speak up and litigate forcefully to protect their rights.” According to Inside Higher Education, approximately $210 million in grants, about half of Princeton’s total grants for the year, were frozen.

– April 1, 2025 – In an interview with Reuters, former Costa Rican president and Nobel laureate Óscar Arias said the US had revoked his visa. The visa revocation came several weeks after Arias posted multiple social media posts critical of the Trump administration. On February 3, Arias compared Trump to a “Roman emperor.” On February 28, he criticized Trump and JD Vance of using “arrogant and humiliating language,” “intimidating words,” and “a series of inappropriate and [sic] threats” in their televised Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “If someone wants to use a reprisal to silence me, well, obviously they’re not going to silence me,” said Arias, who was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an end to conflicts in Central America.

– April 2, 2025 – US District Judge Dale E. Ho dismissed corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams—who spent months currying favor with Trump—but stopped short of dismissing the charges without prejudice, which would have enabled the Justice Department to reinstate the charges at a later date. In his memo to the Southern District of New York, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove had argued that continued prosecution of Adams would interfere with the mayor’s ability to enforce the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. Bove also noted that the order was made “without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.” In his ruling, Judge Ho wrote, “Everything here smacks of a bargain: Dismissal of indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.” He said he had little recourse but to dismiss after the DOJ abandoned the case, but he criticized the Justice Department’s reasoning as “unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep” and rebutted DOJ claims that the prosecution had been political: “There is no evidence—zero—that [Manhattan federal prosecutors] had any improper motives.”

– April 2, 2025 – In a Rose Garden ceremony, President Trump announced sweeping new “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10 percent baseline tariff and significantly higher rates against Japan, China, and the European Union. The following day, the stock market experienced its biggest decline since 2020. The S&P 500 fell 4.84 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.98 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite 5.97 percent. Acknowledging the dramatic stock market declines, Trump compared the tariffs to “an operation, like when a patient gets operated on” and predicted a recovery without evidence: “The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom. And the rest of the world wants to see if there’s any way they can make a deal.” The financial services company JPMorgan said that the tariffs would lead to a recession.

– April 2, 2025 – Following liberal candidate Susan Crawford’s victory in the Wisconsin State Supreme Court election, which was viewed widely as a referendum on Elon Musk, the world’s richest man walked back the results. “I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain,” Musk wrote on his social media company X. He had campaigned vigorously for the conservative candidate Brad Schimel, spending $25 million, including direct payments to voters, and describing the election in existential terms as “one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.” At a Green Bay rally earlier in the week, Musk had handed out two $1 million checks to two individuals who had voted for Schimel. Nevertheless, Crawford won handily by ten percentage points. “Today, Wisconsonites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said during her victory speech. “Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.”

– April 2, 2025 – Millions of dollars in grants to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) were canceled by the Trump administration. NEH provides crucial funding to state humanities councils, museums, historical sites, archives, libraries, educators, media, and schools. Over email, grant recipients were informed that the NEH would be “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the president’s agenda.” Cathy Gorn, executive director of National History Day, one of the programs whose funds were terminated, told The New York Times, “We are in danger of not being able to help this next generation of American citizens understand the nation’s past.”

– April 3, 2025 – The Trump administration laid out a series of demands that Harvard University must meet to avoid losing almost $9 billion in federal grants and contracts. In a letter to Harvard’s president, three federal agencies said Harvard has “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment” and demanded that Harvard ban face masks, clarify its speech policies, make changes to departments that “fuel antisemitic harassment,” ban DEI, adopt “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies, and disclose foreign gifts and contracts. In response to an earlier announcement about the threatened funding cuts, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, wrote in an email that the loss of funds would “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.”

– April 3, 2025 – One day after meeting with far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, Trump fired six national security officials, including the director of the National Security Agency, General Timothy Haugh; Haugh’s civilian deputy, Wendy Noble; and National Security Council Director for Intelligence Brian Walsh. “Always we’re letting go of people,” Trump said on Air Force One. “People that we don’t like or people that we don’t think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to someone else.” During an Oval Office meeting, Loomer presented Trump with printed files of research she had compiled on various officials and urged the president to fire staffers she viewed as insufficiently loyal or who were appointed by former President Joe Biden. Via social media, Loomer accused several of the fired officials of being “disloyal to President Trump” and appeared to confirm her involvement in their removal: “Thank you, President Trump, for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”

– April 3, 2025 – Dr. Mehmet Oz was confirmed as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a 53-45 Senate vote. A celebrity doctor and one-time Republican Senate candidate, Oz has been accused of endorsing products and making recommendations that are not supported by scientific evidence. On The Dr. Oz Show, he suggested apple juice contained dangerous levels of arsenic, promoted green coffee bean extract as a “miracle pill” for weight loss. A 2014 British Medical Journal study found that more than half of Oz’s recommendations on his show either contradicted or were unsupported by scientific research. In 2003, he was banned from presenting research at a conference due to false claims he had made in his research paper abstract. During the pandemic, Oz promoted hydroxychloroquine, a drug to which he had financial ties, as a COVID-19 treatment despite no evidence of its efficacy.

– April 4, 2025 – After a federal judge ordered the federal government to bring back a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller disparaged the judge on social media. “Marxist judge now thinks she’s president of El Salvador,” wrote Miller. Despite having protected legal status and no criminal record in the US, Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland was deported to El Salvador on March 15 in what the Trump administration later admitted was an administrative error. “This was an illegal act,” said Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned no later than April 7, 2025. “Congress said you can’t do it, and you did it anyway.”

– April 4, 2025 – Dozens of international student visas were revoked across the University of California system and at Stanford University. UC-San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said that five UCSD student visas had been rescinded and that a sixth student was “detained at the border, denied entry, and deported to their home country.” “The federal government has not explained the reasons behind these terminations,” said Khosla, who added that the university had received the notifications “without warning.” During a visit to Guyana the previous week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US had revoked approximately three hundred visas, most belonging to students. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,” said Rubio, referring to pro-Palestinian student protesters. “I hope at some point we run out because we have gotten rid of all of them, but we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up.”

– April 4, 2025 – As President Trump golfed in Florida, over 1,400 anti-Trump “Hands Off Rallies” involving an estimated one million people took place across all fifty states. The organizers called for “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration”; “an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on”; and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.” In response, the White House released a statement defending the president and attacking Democrats: “President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.” In a segment that aired two days later on Fox News, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also referred to the protesters as “far-left lunatics” and called Democrats the “party of crazy.”

– April 4, 2025 – An unvaccinated eight-year-old Texas girl with no underlying health conditions died from measles. Following the death of another unvaccinated Texas child with no underlying health conditions on February 25, it was the second such US death since 2015 and the second such US death of a child since 2003. Another unvaccinated person died on March 6 after testing positive for measles, though officials have not yet confirmed the cause of death. As of April 6, 480 measles cases were reported in West Texas, 54 in New Mexico, and 10 in Oklahoma. In an opinion essay for Fox News that was published in early March, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, stopped short of explicitly recommending universal MMR vaccination, calling the decision to vaccinate a “personal” choice. He also advocated for vitamin A treatment, which experts have recommended against using in most measles cases. More recently, Kennedy emphasized untested measles treatments like cod liver oil and hired a discredited vaccine skeptic to research long-debunked links between vaccines and autism.

– April 4, 2025 – Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who expressed frustration with the government’s deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was placed on indefinite leave. Garcia, a Maryland man with protected legal status, was deported in March due to what the government has described as an “administrative error.” In court, Reuveni said that Abrego Garcia “should not have been removed” and added that he did not know why Abrego Garcia was arrested. “I am also frustrated that I have no answers for you on a lot of these questions,” said Reuveni. When asked why the government couldn’t bring Abrego Garcia back, Reuveni responded, “I will say for the court’s awareness that when this case landed on my desk, the first thing I did was ask my client the same question. I have not yet received a satisfactory answer.”

– April 6, 2025 – Trump hosted events that attracted hundreds of donors to his Palm Beach club and resort. Guests gathered at Mar-a Lago for The American Patriots Gala, which featured Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump’s Doral Club also hosted a golf tournament sponsored by the Saudi-backed league LIV Golf. All 643 rooms at the club were full, including the $13,000-per-night Presidential Suite. Trump boasted on social media, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH, RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE.” The day before the events, Trump used his trademark Sharpie pen to announce new global tariffs that erased $5 trillion in market value from S&P 500 companies. Versions of the pen were available at Mar-a-Lago for three dollars.

– April 6, 2025 – Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders. He accused the South Sudanese government of “taking advantage of the United States,” adding, “every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country seeks to remove them.” Rubio also said the US would “prevent further issuance to prevent entry into the United States by South Sudanese passport holders.” South Sudan nationals were granted “temporary protected status” (TPS) by the Obama and Biden administrations. TPS is granted to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary” conditions. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged international leaders to prevent South Sudan from falling “over the abyss” into another civil war.

– April 7, 2025 – Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation in drinking water nationwide. Kennedy said he would assemble a task force to study the issue and make new recommendations. In March 2025, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in drinking water—against the advice of the American Dental Association. Kennedy praised Utah for becoming “the leader in making America healthy again.” Kennedy’s announcement coincided with the elimination of the twenty-person Division of Oral Health. The CDC has stated that community water fluoridation is one of ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century.

– April 7, 2025 – US Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO’S military committee, was fired by the Trump administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth removed Chatfield, “due to a lack of confidence in her ability to lead.” Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation. Of the ten firings of military officers that have taken place during Trump’s second term, five of them were women. In the US military, women make up seventeen percent of the total force.

– April 8, 2025 – Federal District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the White House to restore the Associated Press’s (AP) full access to President Trump. The judge said that banning the news outlet violated the First Amendment. His opinion stated, “The Constitution requires no less.” Trump barred AP reporters from presidential press events because of their refusal to acknowledge Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. In March 2024, AP reporter Josh Boak grilled White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt on the difference between taxes and tariffs. “I think it’s insulting that you’re trying to test my knowledge of economics,” Leavitt said. “I now regret giving a question to the Associated Press.”

– April 9, 2025 – Trump unexpectedly reversed course on steep global tariffs on nearly sixty countries just hours before he put them in place. Trump said he authorized a ninety-day pause in which countries would face “a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff” of 10 percent. Trump did not extend the pause to China. He raised China’s tariffs to a hefty 125 percent. China retaliated by raising levies on American goods to 84 percent. Before the announcement, Trump’s tariffs had wreaked havoc on markets and sparked fears of a recession. “Over the last few days, it looked pretty glum,” Trump said, “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy.” According to the Center for American Progress, the typical American household can now expect to pay an average of $4,600 annually because of Trump’s tariffs.

– April 9, 2025 – Trump faced accusations of market manipulation hours before he paused US global tariffs. At 9:37 a.m., Trump posted on Truth Social, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,” Several hours later, he announced the ninety-day tariff pause, which created a surge in market shares. When questioned about the timing of his decision, Trump said, “I would say this morning. Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it. Fairly early this morning.” Kathleen Clark, a government ethics law expert at Washington University School of Law said, “He’s sending the message that he can effectively and with impunity manipulate the market. As in: Watch this space for future stock tips.”

– April 9, 2025 – The Supreme Court instructed the Trump administration to take steps to bring back Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. The court rejected the administration’s emergency appeal and partially endorsed US District Court Judge Paula Xinis’s order that required the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return” of Mr. Abrego Garcia. The administration conceded that it made a mistake in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, calling it an administrative error. Murray Osario, an attorney representing Abrego Garcia, called the ruling an “overdue first step” that “does nothing to address the government’s obligation to return him safely and immediately to the United States.”

– April 11, 2025 – Trump administration officials recommended deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The proposal included ending "all funding for climate, weather, and ocean Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.” Officials also recommended eliminating the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Office (OAR). The OAR had provided a variety of scientific services, including early warning systems for natural disasters, science education for K-12 students, and the study of the rapidly warming Arctic. The NOAA recommendation came on the heels of the removal of mentions of climate change from federal websites. House Science Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren said she will “do everything [she] can to stand in the way of this idiotic plan.”

– April 11, 2025 – A Louisiana immigration judge ruled that Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, could be deported. Judge Jamee E. Comans said at the hearing that the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.” Khalil recalled Judge Comans saying at a hearing earlier in the week that “there’s nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.” In response to the ruling, Khalil said, “Clearly, what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to the court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”

– April 12, 2025 – Trump continued to escalate the trade war with China, rattling investors, businesses, and consumers. Beijing raised tariffs on US imports to 125 percent after the White House clarified that Chinese imports now face tariffs of 145 percent. US businesses that relied on products from China were faced with halted shipments. In response to the backlash, Trump announced he would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs. Trump proclaimed on Truth Social, “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also tried to allay fears. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing,” she said. “This is a proven economic formula.” Larry Fink, CEO of mega-investment firm BlackRock, was not convinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now.”

– April 13, 2025 – In a memo shared with the Washington Post, State Department officials revealed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio lacked the evidence for revoking the visa of Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk. Yet on March 25, ICE agents detained her anyway. The memo questioned the accusations made by the Trump administration that Ozturk “engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor U.S. attorneys provided evidence to support their claim, a search of U.S. government databases on Ozturk did not reveal any terrorist-related and antisemitc activity. During a hearing in Vermont, Jesse Rossman, Ozturk’s attorney, said, “There is not discretion, even in immigration law, for the government to violate the Constitution.”

– April 13, 2025 – Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that ten more immigrants had been deported to El Salvador. “Last night, another ten criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio posted on social media, without providing any evidence of the deported men’s gang affiliations or that they had been charged with a crime. The Trump administration began deporting immigrants to the notorious Salvadoran prison CECOT in March without due process and based on little more than their tattoos and clothing.

– April 13, 2025 – When asked on Air Force One about claims of human rights abuses at CECOT, the notorious Salvadoran prison where the Trump administration has sent deportees, President Trump responded, “I don’t see it.” CECOT does not allow visitation, recreation, or education, and 65-70 inmates are crammed into each cell. Last year, the human rights organization Cristosal reported that at least 261 people had died in El Salvador’s prisons during a gang crackdown and cited additional cases of abuse, torture, and lack of medical attention. “They only have about half an hour outside of their windowless cells to be outside in a hallway of the prison,” said Margaret Cargioli, a lawyer for Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “They are overcrowded within each of the cells, and they’re sleeping on metal.” The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said they were not aware of any detainees who had ever been released from CECOT.

– April 14, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Trump, El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele told reporters that he would not aid in the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man with protect status who was “accidentally” deported in March by ICE and sent to an El Salvadoran terrorist confinement center. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Garcia, but Attorney General Pam Bondi said the ruling meant that they could only assist in his return if the El Salvadoran government agreed to it. “How can I return [Garcia] to the United States? Like, if I smuggle him into the United States?” President Bukele said, with Trump at his side. “Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous.” Stephen Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, told the New York Times that Garcia’s deportation amounted to a “rule-of-law crisis.” “If the government can do it to Abrego Garcia,” he said, “they can do it to anybody.”

– April 14, 2025 – The Trump administration froze over $2 billion in grants to Harvard University after the school announced it would not comply with the federal government’s demands. In March, Trump’s antisemitism task force placed $9 billion, most of it dedicated to health research and hospital funding, on hold while they investigated the nation’s oldest university’s efforts to stop antisemitism on campus and reviewed its policies around student and faculty protests. On April 11, members of the task force sent a letter to Harvard saying it must change its admissions and hiring policies, as well as end all its DEI programs. In an open letter, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber explained why the school would not agree to the Trump administatrion’s orders, “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.” Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement, condemning her alma mater’s decision. “Harvard University has rightfully earned its place as the epitome of the moral and academic rot in higher education,” she wrote. “It is time to totally cut off U.S. taxpayer funding to this institution that has failed to live up to its founding motto, Veritas.” The money pulled back by the government was to be used for research on HIV, tuberculosis, and traumatic brain injuries.

– April 14, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, President Trump expressed enthusiasm yet again for deporting US citizens convicted of violent crimes to El Salvador. “Homegrown criminals are next. I said homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You’ve gotta build about five more places,” Trump told Bukele, in an exchange that was livestreamed. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters. I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country.” Although Trump said that Attorney General Pam Bondi was studying the matter, legal experts said there was nothing to look into: “It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.

– April 14, 2025 – Stephen Miller, US Homeland Security advisor and White House deputy chief of staff, contradicted Department of Justice documents acknowledging that the Trump administration had made “an administrative error” in deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had protected legal status, to El Salvador. “Nobody was mistakenly deported anywhere,” Miller told reporters outside the White House. “That’s a big mistake that all of you, most of you, have gotten wrong. No one was mistakenly sent anywhere. The only mistake that was made is a lawyer put an incorrect line in a legal filing that’s since been relieved… [Abrego Garcia] is El Salvadorian. He is an illegal alien. He was deported to El Salvador.” On Fox News, Miller doubled down, arguing that Abrego Garcia was not mistakenly deported and stating without evidence that he was a member of MS-13. Mr. Abrego Garcia has denied being a member of any gang, and he has not been convicted of any crime.

– April 14, 2025 – State Department official Pete Marocco, who oversaw the dismantling of 
USAID, stepped down after less than three months on the job. Marocco, who fired thousands 
of USAID staffers and supported plans to cancel 83 percent of USAID programs, had 
previously described USAID as “a money laundering scheme” and accused the agency of 
advancing LGBTQ causes in developing countries and antiauthoritarian movements in former 
Soviet states. Senior USAID officials previously warned Trump administration officials 
that the closure of USAID would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

– April 14, 2025 – Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident, was arrested by immigration officials after arriving for an appointment to take his citizenship test, the final step in the process of becoming a citizen. A Palestinian student at Columbia University who has lived in the US for ten years, Mahdawi participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia, though he stepped back from organizing in March 2024. In a memo, Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Mahdawi—without evidence—of undermining the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment, stating that Mahdawi had “engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders.” However, statements from Mahdawi’s friends and Mahdawi’s own previous statements contradict Rubio’s assertions. “[Mahdawi’s] willingness to actually hear and actively learn and understand the Israeli experience—I mean, I’ve never met anyone who so quickly was willing to take feedback,” said Mikey Baratz, an Israeli who recently graduated from Columbia. In a December 2023 interview about his childhood experience seeing his friend killed by an Israeli soldier, Mahdawi said he wanted a peaceful end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: “My motivation comes out of love now, not out of anger, not out of hate.”

– April 15, 2025 – In an interview on Fox News, border czar Tom Homan said he would deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia again if he were returned to the US, openly defying court orders. “Now, if somehow he comes back and that happens, he’s going to be detained and removed again. He’s an MS-13 gang member based on our intelligence and El Salvador’s intelligence,” said Homan without providing details or evidence to support his claims. Abrego Garcia, who has protected legal status, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March in what the Trump administration has admitted was “an administrative error.” The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego’s return, but so far, little has been done.

– April 15, 2025 – One day after the Trump administration froze $2 billion in grants to Harvard University for rejecting its policy demands, President Trump threatened the school’s tax-exempt status on Truth Social: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Almost all colleges and universities have tax-exempt status, and federal law prohibits the executive branch from “directly or indirectly” ordering the IRS to conduct specific tax investigations. “Selective prosecution of your political adversaries through the tax system is the stuff of dictatorship. This is unconscionable and wrong but a continuation of trends we have seen in President Trump’s approach both to universities and to tax enforcement,” said Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard.

– April 16, 2025 – Following Trump’s executive order “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” in February and months of escalating threats, the Trump administration sued Maine for refusing to ban transgender athletes from women’s sports. The lawsuit accused Maine of violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, and called for a compensation program for “female athletes who have been denied equal athletic opportunities.” “This is about sports,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “This is also about these women’s personal safety.” Maine Governor Janet Mills countered: “This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed. It is about states’ rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.” Transgender people make up less than .002 percent of US college athletes, and trans women have been competing in women’s sports for decades.

– April 16, 2025 – Disregarding established scientific research, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that autism was preventable and that an increase in autism cases was caused solely by environmental factors. “Genes don’t cause epidemics. You need an environmental toxin,” Kennedy said. Researchers maintain that the increase in autism cases was instead due to better screening, awareness, and access, as well as broader definitions of autism and more parents having children later in life. Though environmental factors may possibly contribute to whether a child develops autism, there is no evidence to suggest that autism is preventable, and scientists have known since the 1970s that genes play a role. “Autism is not an infectious disease. So there aren’t preventative measures that we can take,” said Dr. Joshua Anbar, a professor at Arizona State University who collected data for the CDC report on autism showing increased rates. Added Dr. Catherine Lord, a psychologist and autism researcher, “We know there is a clear genetic contribution. That is not in question.” Kennedy has also repeatedly promoted false theories that vaccines cause autism.

– April 16, 2025 – The Trump administration moved to redefine what it means to “harm” a protected species under the Endangered Species Act. According to the Endangered Species Act, the definition of “harm” includes “significant habitat modification or degradation,” a definition upheld by a 1995 Supreme Court ruling. The Trump administration proposal seeks to narrow the definition of “harm” so that only taking direct action to kill or injure a species would qualify, a move that would make it significantly easier to log, build, or drill for oil. “What they’re proposing will just fundamentally upend how we’ve been protecting endangered species in this country,” said Noah Greenwald, codirector of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. Habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction in the US.

– April 16, 2025 – Two days after the Trump administration froze $2 billion in grants to Harvard University and one day after President Trump threatened the school’s tax-exempt status on social media, the Department of Homeland Security canceled another $2.7 million in grants to Harvard and threatened to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students. In a letter sent to Harvard, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard provide detailed records on foreign student visa holders’ “known illegal” and “known dangerous or violent” activities by April 30, 2025, or the school would lose its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification. “Harvard bending the knee to antisemitism—driven by its spineless leadership—fuels a cesspool of extremist riots and threatens our national security,” Noem said in a press statement. A Harvard spokeswoman said the school was aware of Noem’s letter, which she said “followed on the heels of our statement that Harvard will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”

– April 17, 2025 – Following a deadly shooting at Florida State University that left two dead and six injured, President Trump said he would not support stricter gun control measures. “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” Trump told reporters. “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment, among many other things, and I will always protect the Second Amendment.” One FSU student who survived the shooting, Robbie Alhadeff, previously lost his sister Alyssa in the 2018 Parkland High School massacre. “A lot of the people I’m friends with are from Parkland, and a lot of them go to FSU. This is the second time it’s happened—and no one I know wants to go back to school,” said Alhadeff. In February, Trump signed an executive order directing the attorney general to withdraw several Biden administration gun regulations.

– April 17, 2025 – During an Oval Office meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, President Trump told reporters that he had the power to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who had recently warned that Trump’s tariffs would likely lead to significant economic damage. “Oh, he’ll leave. If I ask him to, he’ll be out of there,” Trump said. “I don’t think he’s doing the job. He’s too late, always too late. Little slow, and I’m not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast.” Earlier in the day, Trump had criticized Powell and called for his removal in a social media post riddled with inaccurate and misleading information: “The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, ‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’ Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” No Federal Reserve chair has ever been fired by a president, and the Federal Reserve Act states that board members may only be removed “for cause,” which has historically been interpreted as misconduct or incapacity.

– April 17, 2025 – At the direction of DOGE, three-quarters of AmeriCorps staff members were placed on administrative leave. Established in 1993 under a different name, AmeriCorps was designed as a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Its young volunteers work on community service projects related to disaster services, environmental stewardship, education, and veterans’ affairs, among others. The layoffs included employees who work for a national disaster response program and may affect work in areas impacted by Hurricane Helene. The following day, California Governor Gavin Newsom decried the layoffs and announced that California would sue to stop the dismantling of AmeriCorps: “We’ve gone from the New Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society to a federal government that gives a middle finger to volunteers serving their fellow Americans.”

– April 17, 2025 – The Trump administration sent termination notices to 90 percent of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency that supervises financial institutions and enforces federal consumer protection laws. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has returned $21 billion to defrauded consumers since its founding in 2011. The layoffs are part of the administration’s larger attempts to dismantle the CFPB, which has been criticized by prominent Trump donors, including Elon Musk, as a barrier to their business interests. In February, Elon Musk’s X announced a deal with Visa to offer mobile payment services, which would be regulated by the CFPB. “The fact that Musk is now engaged in payment businesses that would be regulated by the CFPB at the same time he’s trying to tear down the CFPB puts in sharp relief the conflicts of interest here and how much this disserves the general public,” said Richard Cordray, a former director of the CFPB. “The whole situation is rife with conflicts of interest.”

– April 17, 2025 – President Trump signed two executive orders aimed at the commercial
fishing industry. The first, “Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific,”
opened the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, one of the world’s largest 
ocean reserves, to commercial fishing; the second, “Restoring American Seafood 
Competitiveness,” ordered the Commerce Department to loosen regulations on the 
commercial fishing industry. While some fishermen celebrated the move, environmentalists 
argued that opening the Pacific Islands National Monument to commercial fishing would 
harm the area’s ecosystem and endanger marine life. In response, Angelo Villagomez, a 
senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said that opening up marine monuments 
to industrial fishing “sets a dangerous precedent that our public lands and waters are 
for sale to the highest bidder.”

– April 18, 2025 – Escalating its crackdown on Harvard University, the Trump 
administration accused Harvard of failing to report large foreign donations. In a 
letter to the university’s president, the Department of Education demanded that 
Harvard provide a list of all foreign donors, turn over all records of foreign 
donor communication dating back to 2020, and provide details on foreigners who 
had spent time at Harvard, dating back to 2010. “Today’s records request is the 
Trump administration’s first step to ensure Harvard is not being manipulated by, 
or doing the bidding of, foreign entities,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, 
without providing any evidence to support her department’s accusations against 
Harvard. Pushing back against the accusations, Harvard responded that it had 
filed such reports for decades “as part of its ongoing compliance with the law”:https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-demands-harvards-foreign-funding-records-acc11947 
“As is required, Harvard’s reports include information on gifts and contracts from 
foreign sources exceeding $250K annually. This includes contracts to provide 
executive education, other training, and academic publications.”

– April 19, 2025 – Vice President JD Vance attempted to airbrush his meeting with Vatican officials after Pope Francis did not attend, instead sending his deputy, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, to reportedly lecture Vance about compassion. “There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions, and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the Vatican said in a statement. In response, Vance’s office released photos of the vice president smiling and laughing with Vatican officials and walking through the Vatican with his children. “The Vice President and Cardinal Parolin discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump’s commitment to restoring world peace,” Vance’s office said. In February, Pope Francis criticized the Trump administration’s deportation policies and urged Catholics to reject anti-immigrant narratives. Without mentioning Vance by name, the pope rebuked the vice president’s invocation of ordo amoris, which Vance had characterized as a hierarchy of duties prioritizing one’s family and community over the rest of the world, to defend the administration’s deportations: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.” In his final public statement on Easter Sunday, Pope Francis reiterated the importance of rejecting xenophobia: “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants! On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those different from ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life, and ideas! For all of us are children of God!” Hours later, Pope Francis died of a stroke and cardiovascular arrest.

– April 19, 2025 – Two weeks after hundreds of thousands marched against the Trump administration in 1,400 “Hands Off!” rallies across the country, a new wave of “50501” anti-Trump protests were held nationwide to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolution. According to the protest’s organizers, over three million people attended the 50501 protests. While some protesters gathered outside the White House, Trump was at his golf course.

– April 20, 2025 – In an Easter post on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at his enemies and repeated his debunked claims about the 2020 election. His post included “Radical Left Lunatics,” “WEAK and INCOMPETENT judges,” and “Sleepy Joe Biden.” Trump declared, “He was, by far, our WORST and most Incompetent President—But to him, and to the person that ran and manipulated the Auto Pen (perhaps our REAL President!), and to all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!” Republicans Against Trump, a group of GOP supporters who don’t back Trump, wrote in an X post, “Ah yes, the true spirit of Easter: rage-posting about your political enemies.”

– April 21, 2025 – Trump announced that undocumented immigrants should not be entitled to trials and insisted that his administration should be allowed to deport them without appearing before a judge. “I hope we get cooperation from the courts. We have thousands of people that are ready to go out and you can’t have a trial for all these people.” Trump added, “A judge can’t say, ‘No, you have to have a trial.’ The trial is going to take two years. We’re going to have a very dangerous country if we’re not allowed to do what we’re entitled to do.” In response to Trump’s statements, Representative Jonathan L. Jackson, Democrat of Illinois, wrote on social media, “‘We can’t give everyone a trial’—excuse me, what?! That’s straight-up #dictator talk… If you want to shred the Constitution, just say so.”

– April 21, 2025 – The president continued his attacks against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump called Powell “a major loser” and demanded that the Central Bank lower its key interest rate to boost the economy. Trump stated that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually no inflation.” Food prices jumped in January and March, and overall inflation remained above the Fed’s 2 percent target. After Trump’s attack on Powell, the Dow dropped by more than 1,000 points, and the broad S&P 500 stock index tumbled nearly 3 percent. The dollar fell to its lowest level in three years.

– April 21, 2025 – The White House expressed support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after The New York Times reported that he shared sensitive military information in another Signal chat. The chat included Hegseth’s wife and brother. Trump said, “It’s just fake news. They just bring up stories. I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “This is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement.” In an interview with Politico, Republican Representative and former Air Force General Don Bacon said, “Russia and China are all over his phone, and for him to be putting secret stuff on his phone is not right… He’s acting like he’s above the law—and that shows an amateur person.”

– April 22, 2025 – A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America (VOA), the government-funded broadcaster. Trump and his Republican allies had accused VOA of having a “leftist bias” and “failing to project pro-American values.” In defending VOA’s mission, plaintiff attorneys wrote, “That simple mission is a powerful one for those living across the globe without access to a free press and without the ability to otherwise discern what is truly happening.” Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated the administration’s move to decimate the agency was “arbitrary” and “capricious.” He went on to say, “Not only is there an absence of ‘reasoned analysis’ from the defendants; there is an absence of any analysis whatsoever.”

– April 22, 2025 – Trump announced that Elon Musk would step back from his role as director of DOGE. The move corresponded with a steep decline in Tesla’s profits. Trump supported Musk’s move and said, “He saved us a lot of money.” Without providing details, Musk said he had saved taxpayers $150 billion. The figure was 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save. Musk’s and DOGE’s miscalculations stemmed from the financial costs of their chainsaw for bureaucracy policy. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, used budget figures to produce a rough estimate that firings, rehirings, lost productivity, and paid leave of thousands of workers would cost upward of $135 billion.

– April 23, 2025 – Trump demanded that Ukraine agree to a proposal that would grant Russia all the Crimean territory it has gained in the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded, “There is nothing to talk about. It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people.” On social media, Trump said that Zelenskyy was being “inflammatory” and “would only prolong the killing field.” He told reporters at the White House that the deal was on the verge of acceptance by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump added, “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it’s harder.” Russia overtook the Crimean Peninsula by force in 2014. The peninsula is roughly the size of the US state of Maryland.

 – April 24, 2025 – A federal judge paused a key section of Trump’s executive order that proposed sweeping changes to voting and elections. Trump’s March 24 order stated that election fraud was rampant. “This will end it, hopefully,” he said when signing it. Past audits have proven election fraud to be very rare. The order instructed the independent Election Assistance Commission to require that applicants prove US citizenship before they can be registered to vote. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with voting rights groups and Democrats, saying that the Constitution gives the power to regulate federal elections to states and Congress—not the president. During the 2024 election, Trump pushed a baseless narrative that large numbers of noncitizens were poised to vote and swing the election for Democrats.

– April 25, 2025 – The FBI arrested Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan and charged her in federal court for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest. The arrest escalated the Trump administration’s focus on judges’ conduct related to immigration enforcement. FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X: “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject—an illegal alien—to evade arrest.” He said that agents arrested Ruiz after he was “chased down.” Patel added that “the judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.” On Truth Social, Trump shared an image of the judge found on her Facebook page by the right-wing blogger Libs of TikTok. The image showed Dugan on the bench wearing a KN95 face mask and displaying the Ukrainian national symbol of a trident.

– April 25, 2025 – In a possible violation of Justice Department policy, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media of Judge Hannah Dugan’s perp walk with the caption, “No one is above the law.” According to the DOJ’s Confidentiality and Media Contacts Policy, DOJ personnel are not permitted to “voluntarily disclose a photograph of a defendant unless it serves a law enforcement function or unless the photograph is already part of the public record.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who implemented the policy during the Obama administration, said Patel’s post violated the policy. “Whatever the issues with what the judge did, they’re trying to maximize intimidation.”

– April 25, 2025 – A two-year-old US citizen was deported to Honduras with her pregnant mother and eleven-year-old sister despite an emergency petition filed by the child’s father. US District Court Judge Terry A. Doughty called the deportation “illegal and unconstitutional” and stated that he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process.” The two-year-old child, referred to in court papers as V. M. L., had accompanied her mother and sister to an immigration appointment in New Orleans, where the three were subsequently detained by ICE. After the child’s mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, was scheduled for an expedited removal, Justice Department lawyers claimed in a filing that Lopez Villela told ICE that she wanted to retain custody of V. M. L. and to take the child with her to Honduras. The child’s father disputed this narrative, and Lopez Villela’s consent has not been independently verified. According to the ACLU, Lopez Villela was not allowed to speak with lawyers and was only permitted to speak with her husband for less than a minute before she was deported. ICE did not coordinate any continuity of prenatal care or medical oversight for Lopez Villela.

– April 25, 2025 – A four-year-old US citizen and seven-year-old US citizen were deported with their mother to Honduras. The family did not have the opportunity to speak with lawyers before they were deported, according to the National Immigration Project. Lawyers for the family said the mother was not given an option to leave the children in the United States and that the four-year-old boy, who has a rare form of late-stage cancer, did not have access to his medications or doctors while in custody. “Deporting U.S. citizen children is illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral,” said Erin Herbert, a lawyer with Ware Immigration. “The speed, brutality, and clandestine manner in which these children were deported is beyond unconscionable, and every official responsible for it should be held accountable.”

– April 26, 2025 – Trump traveled to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis. Before leaving, he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The topic of their conversation was Russia’s killing of civilians earlier in the week. Following the meeting, Trump posted on Truth Social that there was “no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” At the funeral, the president broke the Vatican’s dress code by wearing a blue suit. He was also seen checking his phone and chewing gum. Trump spent only fourteen hours in Rome. He told aides that he wanted to return to his golf resort in New Jersey by the end of the day.

– April 27, 2025 – A CNN poll showed that Trump’s approval ratings had plummeted as he approached the hundred-day mark of his presidency. Only 41 percent of respondents approved of his job performance—the lowest any president has polled at the one hundred-day mark in seven decades. Forty-five percent said they strongly disapproved of Trump’s handling of the presidency, and just 40 percent said they have a favorable view of the president. Trump lost support from women, Hispanic Americans, and political independents. Since March 2025, when Trump’s tariff plan led to declines in the stock market, the president’s approval ratings on economic issues fell significantly, including a 9 percent drop on inflation and a 4 percent drop on tariffs. Trump dismissed the bad polling and suggested that new organizations that published them should be investigated for “election fraud.”

– April 28, 2025 – President Trump signed two executive orders targeting sanctuary cities, immigrants, and officials accused of “obstructing criminal or immigration law enforcement.” The first order, “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens,” directed the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of so-called sanctuary cities and to pursue “all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures”; the order also told federal agencies to stop enforcing state and local laws that allow undocumented immigrants to receive in-state tuition benefits in higher education. The second order, “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens,” directed the Trump administration to provide additional resources to law enforcement, including legal resources to cops accused of wrongdoing, modifications to existing restraints such as federal consent decrees, and military equipment to local law enforcement; the order also instructs law enforcement to pursue legal action against state or local officials accused of “obstructing criminal or immigration law enforcement.” “These orders have no legal basis and are another example of President Trump’s relentless campaign to attack the integrity of our legal system and separation of powers by targeting judges, lawyers, and other officials who refuse to comply with his extreme agenda,” said Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division.

– April 28, 2025 – As part of the Trump administration’s efforts to promote its immigration crackdown, one hundred mug-shot-style posters of arrested immigrants were erected on the White House lawn. The posters included the words ARRESTED and ILLEGAL ALIEN as well as text specifying the alleged crimes of those depicted. Although the posters did not include the immigrants’ names, they were identified in a White House press release. A White House social media account posted a video panning across the posters as Michael Bublé’s “Feeling Good” played in the background. “Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” said border czar Tom Homan. “Every sick person we take off the street, especially child rapists, makes this country safer.” According to ICE’s own latest data, 46 percent of detainees in mid-April had no criminal record.

– April 28, 2025 – In an interview with The Atlantic, President Trump bragged about how much fun he’s having during his second presidency. When asked whether his second term felt different than his first, Trump said, “The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys. And the second time, I run the country and the world.” Later, he acknowledged, “I’m having a lot of fun, considering what I do. You know, what I do is such serious stuff.” Added Brian Ballard, a lobbyist and Trump ally: “The first time, the first weeks, it was just ‘Let’s blow this place up.’ This time, he’s blowing it up with a twinkle in his eye.”

– April 29, 2025 – During an interview with ABC News’ Terry Moran, President Trump incorrectly stated that Kilmar Abrego Garcia—the Maryland man with protected legal status who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported due to an “administrative error”—had “MS-13” tattooed on his knuckles. The president appeared to be referring to an altered photo of Abrego Garcia’s hand that he had posted to social media the previous week. The photo showed four of Garcia’s fingers with tattoos of a leaf, a face, a cross, and a skull. Above the tattoos, the term “MS13” was digitally superimposed as a caption. When Moran told Trump that the letters were photoshopped, Trump snapped, “Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes, he does,’ and, you know, go on to something else.”

– April 29, 2025 – Trump marked one hundred days in office by railing against immigrants and attacking his opponents during a Michigan rally. “We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first hundred days of any administration in the history of our country,” Trump said, surrounded by screens reading “100 Days of Greatness.” During his ninety-minute speech, Trump repeated lies about the 2020 election being stolen, mocked how Joe Biden looked in a bathing suit, and bragged about his immigration crackdown. “Removing the invaders is not just a campaign pledge, it’s my solemn duty as commander-in-chief,” Trump said. The crowd cheered as Trump played a video of deportees arriving at the notorious El Salvador prison, CECOT, and having their heads shaved. The Daily Beast declared Trump’s first one hundred days the “worst” in history.

– April 29, 2025 – Wired reported that Christopher Sweet, a college junior, was tasked with using AI to propose rewrites to Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations for DOGE. In an email sent to HUD employees, Sweet was introduced as a student at the University of Chicago, studying economics and data science. His role has involved reviewing HUD regulations, comparing them to existing laws, and identifying areas where the rules could be relaxed or eliminated. As the lead on the AI deregulation project, Sweet was given access to HUD’s data repository on public housing and its enterprise income verification systems. He had no previous government experience.

– April 29, 2025 – In a social media post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted about cutting the Women, Peace, and Security program, which encourages more women to play active roles in national security issues: “This morning, I proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security’ (WPS) program inside the @DeprtofDefense. WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops—distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING….GOOD RIDDANCE WPS!” Two Trump cabinet members—Secretary of State Marco Rubio and DHS Secretary Kristi L. Noem—previously cosponsored the bill establishing the program, which Trump himself signed into law in 2017. Women remain underrepresented in national security roles.

– April 30, 2025 – The Commerce Department reported that the US economy had its worst quarter since 2022. GDP fell to an annualized rate of -0.3 percent, a sharp drop from the fourth quarter’s 2.4 percent rate, and the stock market declined after the announcement. Peter Navarro, special counselor to the president, attempted to spin the GDP report as “very positive news for America,” and President Trump, in a social media post, blamed the weak economic numbers on former president Biden: “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.” Economists have instead blamed the weak numbers on the chaos and uncertainty created in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs.

– April 30, 2025 – The Trump administration announced that it had signed a mineral deal with Ukraine that will give the US a share in future revenues from Ukraine’s mineral reserves; the deal did not include explicit security guarantees for Ukraine. “This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.” At a CPAC conference several months ago, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to pay the US back for military aid. “I want them to give us something for all the money we put up. So we’re asking for rare earth and oil—anything we can get!” said Trump. “We’re going to get our money back because it’s not fair.” Two days after announcing the minerals deal, the State Department said it was stepping back from mediating the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

– April 30, 2025 – On Trump’s 101st day in office, The New York Times published an article in which historians claimed many of Trump’s actions were unprecedented. The thirty-five historians categorized six of Trump’s actions as having “no clear historical precedent”: invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants; dismantling USAID; renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”; withholding federal funding from universities; declaring a “national energy emergency”; and issuing more than one hundred executive orders in his first one hundred days. The historians also categorized five of Trump’s actions as having “no precedent in the modern era”: ignoring a federal judge’s order; asserting broad power over independent federal agencies; ordering or calling for an end to birthright citizenship; repeatedly stating a desire to acquire another nation’s sovereign land; and imposing universal tariffs.

– April 30, 2025 – Just one day before Mike Waltz was ousted as National Security Advisor, a Reuters photographer captured a photo of him using a modified version of Signal during a cabinet meeting. The photo showed that Waltz was communicating via Signal with Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Although the version of Signal that Waltz was using retains copies of messages to comply with government record preservation regulations, it is not approved for sensitive government communications. In March, Waltz came under fire after he accidentally included a journalist on a Signal group chat in which war plans were discussed.

– April 30, 2025 – During a televised Cabinet meeting, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Donald Trump had saved the lives of 258 million Americans, or three-quarters of the population. “Since you have been in office, President Trump, your DOJ agencies have seized more than 22 million fentanyl pills—3,400 kilos of fentanyl… which saved—are you ready for this, media?—258 million lives,” said Bondi. Just two days earlier, on Fentanyl Awareness Day, Bondi had posted on social media that Trump had saved 119 million lives. According to experts, fentanyl seizures show only how much fentanyl didn’t make it into the US, and the relationship between fentanyl entering the US and overdose deaths is less clear. “Bondi’s statements demonstrate profound ignorance about fentanyl and interdiction,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction. He added, “119 million Americans do not even use fentanyl, and to risk an overdose requires intentional ingestion of fentanyl or another illicit drug contaminated with fentanyl. Fentanyl overdose is not a risk for people who do not use drugs.” In 2024, opioid overdose deaths declined in the US for the first time in six years, which many have attributed to the wider availability of Narcan; a draft budget proposal showed that the Trump administration planned to eliminate a $56 million Narcan program.

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes
March 2025: Atrocities 69-133

Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-spinning number of misdeeds coming from his administration. We called this list a collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s second term.

MARCH 2025
– March 1, 2025 – Despite his history of documented grammar and spelling issues, President Trump signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States. The order revoked a Clinton-era mandate requiring federal agencies to provide services and translated documents to people who speak limited English. Although the order’s practical impact may be limited, pro-immigration groups warned that the order may stigmatize immigrants and make it more difficult for non-English speakers to access government services. At CPAC in February, Trump explicitly linked his contempt for other languages to his anti-immigration agenda: “We have languages coming into our country. We don’t have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language. These are languages—it’s the craziest thing—they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It’s a very horrible thing.”

– March 2, 2025 – Trump directed federal agencies to increase timber production across 280 million acres of national forests. His executive order stated, “The United States has an abundance of timber resources, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources.” Trump’s order pressed federal agencies to bypass endangered species protections and other environmental regulations. “They’re not hiding the ball,” said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, a senior legislative representative at Earthjustice, a public interest environmental law organization. “It’s just about trying to cut as much of our forests as possible to line the pockets of timber industry executives.” Trump nominated Tom Schulz, a former lumber industry executive, to lead the Forest Service.

– March 3, 2025 – Elon Musk’s DOGE removed hundreds more claims from its mistake-filled “wall of receipts.” The deleted claims erased $4 billion in savings that the group said it had made for US taxpayers. The items removed included five of the seven largest savings that it had claimed credit for the previous week. The New York Times reported the mistakes included “canceled contracts” that had been completed during previous presidential administrations. In 2005, the US Coast Guard contracted with a Virginia firm for administrative assistance. The contract was completed in June 2005, and the firm was paid $144,000. DOGE’s team reported they had canceled the contract and had saved US taxpayers $53.7 million.

– March 4, 2025 – At a joint session of Congress, Trump gave the longest address before the House and Senate in modern presidential history. Republicans chanted “USA! USA!” as they listened to Trump’s misleading and false statements about government fraud, Social Security, immigration, the economy, and transgender mice. Democrats held up signs in protest that read, UNTRUE and MUSK STEALS. Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, shouted at Trump that he did not have a mandate, and was removed from the chamber by security. Green later said, “It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up” to Trump.

– March 4, 2025 – In a closed-door meeting, Representative Richard Hudson (R-NC), the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told GOP lawmakers to stop holding in-person town halls in their districts. Several Republicans had received angry blowback from their constituents, largely over DOGE’s massive cuts. Yet according to the party line, that wasn’t the reason for the pause on town halls. “There are people who do this as a profession,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters. “They’re professional protesters.” While some liberal advocacy groups encouraged people to attend the town halls, there was no evidence that any of the attendees had been paid.

– March 5, 2025 – The Department of Veterans Affairs announced it would reduce its workforce by more than 80,000. “We take good care of our veterans,” Trump said. “But we are having great success in slimming down our government.” More than 25 percent of the VA’s workforce is composed of veterans. Gregg Bafundo, a Marine who served during the first Gulf War said, “They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground.”

– March 6, 2025 – Trump announced a reprieve on imposing a 25 percent tariff on products from Mexico and Canada. When asked if the decision was based on the stock market, Trump said it had nothing to do with it. “I’m not even looking at the market, because long term the United States will be very strong with what is happening.” Trump’s comments came as the Dow Jones went down 400 points and the Nasdaq Composite closed more than 10 percent below its recent high, as investors continued to worry about the Trump administration’s chaotic economic plan. “The president wants American growth and American prosperity, okay?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, “You’re going to see the stock market explode.”

– March 7, 2025 – References to the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II, were marked for deletion as part of the Department of Defense’s efforts to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion content in accordance with President Trump’s executive order. Other images and posts containing the word “gay,” including references to people with the common last name “Gay,” were also flagged for deletion. The aircraft was named after Enola Gay Tibbets, mother of military pilot Paul Tibbits, and it was not, in fact, gay.

– March 7, 2025 – The Trump administration canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University for the school’s “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The Trump administration has targeted universities over their DEI policies and handling of pro-Palestinian protests, which began at Columbia in the spring of 2024. “There’s no question that some complaints of antisemitism at Columbia and other universities are valid,” wrote Rabbi Jill Jacobs, CEO of T’ruah. “But Trump’s withholding funds from Columbia… [is] about advancing the administration’s assault on universities, free speech, academic freedom and liberal democracy, not combating antisemitism.”

– March 8, 2025 – ICE arrested and detained graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who played a key role in the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia University. Revoking a green card is a rare and usually lengthy process that, in the vast majority of cases, occurs only after the green card holder has been accused and convicted of a crime. “Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump administration will not tolerate it.” Despite refusing to say what specific crime Khalil had committed, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the arrest, saying, “I’m going to say this clearly: If you’re on a student visa, and you’re in America and you’re an aspiring young terrorist who wants to prey upon your Jewish classmates, you’re going home,” he said. “We’re going to arrest your tail. We’re going to send you home where you belong.” In contrast, Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of UC Berkeley Law School who has criticized the pro-Palestine student movement in the past, said, “Arresting and seeking to deport a Columbia University student for his speech activities clearly violates the First Amendment—and does nothing to combat antisemitism on campus.”

– March 9, 2025 – In a Fox News interview, President Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession resulting from his tariff policies. When asked directly whether he expected a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” Citing Trump’s policies, including his sweeping tariffs, both Goldman Sachs and Yardeni Research raised their odds of a recession occurring in the next twelve months.

– March 10, 2025 – Following Trump’s statements the previous day about a possible recession, the stock market experienced its worst decline of the year. The Dow lost almost 900 points, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7 percent, and the Nasdaq dropped 4 percent. In response, White House officials attempted to downplay the sell-offs. “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward,” said Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director. “But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.” Another White House official added, “We’re seeing a strong divergence between animal spirits of the stock market and what we’re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders.” “Blips” or “animal spirits” aside, many remained unconvinced. “We anticipate lasting damage to global economic activity,” said BNP Paribas strategists.

– March 10, 2025 – Amazon announced that it would begin streaming The Apprentice, the reality television show starring Donald Trump, on Prime Video. Following a series of bankruptcies and bad business deals by Trump, The Apprentice relaunched Donald Trump as a global icon of American success, paving his eventual run for the presidency. As an executive producer on the show, Trump will likely financially profit from Amazon’s acquisition. The announcement is only the latest example of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s attempts to curry favor with the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Prime Video announced the acquisition of a Melania Trump documentary on which the first lady served as executive producer. The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, also refused to endorse a presidential candidate in the last presidential election and announced new editorial policies favoring conservative viewpoints.

– March 11, 2025 – The Department of Education fired more than 1,300 employees, reducing its total staff to roughly half the number at the beginning of the year. In an interview on Fox News, Education Secretary Linda McMahon described the mass layoffs as the first step toward shutting down the Education Department, which requires congressional approval. “[Trump’s] directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know we’ll have to work with Congress, you know, to get that accomplished. But what we did today was to take the first step of eliminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat,” said McMahon. According to Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the layoffs “will send class sizes soaring, cut job training programs, make higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, take away special education services for students with disabilities, and gut student civil rights protections.”

– March 11, 2025 – Erica Y. Carr, the acting executive secretary of USAID, ordered Washington employees to burn or shred classified documents and personnel files. “Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,” Carr wrote in an email. Her order came amid legal challenges related to the Trump administration’s attempts to dismantle USAID. The Federal Records Act of 1950 forbids the destruction of government documents without prior approval from the National Archives and Records Administration. “This is slash-and-burn mode and not leaving any evidence behind that could disprove their narrative,” said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors.

– March 11, 2025 – Following nationwide protests at Tesla facilities and declines in Tesla’s stock in response to CEO Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration, President Trump turned the White House lawn into a makeshift Tesla showroom. With Musk at his side, the influencer-in-chief strolled among five different Tesla models, eventually deciding to purchase a red Model S for use by his staff despite his repeated criticisms of electric vehicles in the past and his signing of an executive order revoking Biden-era electric vehicle targets. Trump’s said reason for the purchase was to help out Musk, who recently indicated he would donate $100 million to Trump political operation groups. “I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” said Trump. “And I just want people to know that he can’t be penalized for being a patriot.” In response to a reporter’s question, Trump said he would consider labeling those committing violence against Tesla owners and dealerships as “domestic terrorists.”

– March 12, 2025 – While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, President Trump used the term “Palestinian” as a slur to describe Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and falsely stated that Schumer, who became the highest-ranking elected Jewish politician in American history as Senate majority leader, “was not Jewish.” “Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I’m concerned,” Trump said. "He’s become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.” Jewish and Muslim groups quickly condemned Trump’s remarks. Trump previously used the term “Palestinian” as a slur to refer to Schumer during rallies and in a social media post in February. He also used the term as a slur in his presidential debate with Joe Biden, calling Biden “a very bad Palestinian.”

– March 12, 2025 – The Environmental Protection Agency canceled $20 billion in climate and green energy grants, and said it would repeal dozens of environmental protections against air and water pollution. In a video posted on social media, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin praised the changes without once mentioning the environment or public health. “From the campaign trail to Day One and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Zeldin said, celebrating March 12, 2025, as “the greatest day of deregulation in American history” even as former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy called it “the most disastrous day in EPA history.”

– March 12, 2025 – Following the Trump administration’s cuts to federal research funding, the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School rescinded all offers of admission to its graduate biomedical program for 2025–2026. The funding cuts have also impacted programs at Duke University, Vanderbilt University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, among others. “This is a severe blow to science and the training of the next generation of scientists,” said Siyuan Wang, a geneticist and cell biologist at Yale School of Medicine. “With fewer scientists, there will be less science and innovation that drive societal progress and the improvement of public health.”

– March 13, 2025 – Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian who took part in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, was arrested in Newark for overstaying her student visa. “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” said Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Kordia’s arrest came hours after DHS officials searched two Columbia University dorm rooms as part of what Todd Blanche, US deputy attorney general, described as an investigation into Columbia’s “harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.” Sebastian Javadpoor, a Columbia University student, said, “We have students who are so scared about the possibility of retaliation, about the possibility of having ICE reported on them, that they’re too afraid to call public safety if something happens to them.”

– March 13, 2025 – Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University’s medical school, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport after returning from visiting family in Lebanon. Despite having a valid visa and a court order temporarily blocking her expulsion, Dr. Alawieh was subsequently deported. “They did not do anything to stop the plane,” said Dr. Basma Merhi, Dr. Alawieh’s colleague and lawyer. “So, clearly, they wanted to deport her regardless of if there was a judge’s order or not. She didn’t do anything wrong.”

– March 13, 2025 – Fabian Schmidt, a green card holder who lives in New Hampshire, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport after returning from Luxembourg. Schmidt’s mother, Astrid Senior, said her son was “violently interrogated.” “He had to go and be stripped naked and was showered by two officers with ice cold water, and was interrogated again,” she said. “He hardly got anything to drink. And then he wasn’t feeling very well, and he collapsed.” Fabian Schmidt came to the country legally in 20007. He lives with his partner and child, who are both American citizens.

– March 14, 2025 – Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted surveillance footage of Columbia University student Ranjani Srinivasan walking through LaGuardia Airport on social media. In her post, Noem wrote that she was “glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport.” Srinivasan, a Columbia University doctoral student and Fulbright recipient, fled to Canada after her student visa was abruptly revoked without explanation. The Department of Homeland Security later issued a statement accusing Srinivasan, without evidence, of being “involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization.”

– March 14, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order dismantling seven federal agencies, including the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA). “President Trump is delivering on his promise to make our government more efficient. American taxpayers should not be funding anti-American propaganda in the name of journalism,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941, Voice of America provides news in fifty languages to more than 354 million people worldwide. Trump’s order dismantling VOA was celebrated by Russian and Chinese state media. In a social media post, fired VOA reporter Liam Scott described the gutting of VOA and other agencies as “part of the administration’s broader assault on press freedom and the media”: “I’ve covered press freedom for a long time, and I’ve never seen something like what’s happened in the US over the past couple months.”

– March 14, 2025 – In a speech at the Department of Justice, President Trump attacked and vowed retribution against those who had worked on cases against him, including Manhattan district attorney Alvin L. Bragg, former special counsel Jack Smith, and former FBI director James Comey. “These are people that are bad people, really bad people,” Trump said. “They tried to turn America into a corrupt communist and third-world country, but in the end, the thugs failed and the truth won.” Trump also lavished praise on Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who dismissed the classified documents case against him, and Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who both represented him in criminal cases and were subsequently appointed to DOJ roles. Trump also proclaimed himself “chief law enforcement officer,” a title typically reserved for the attorney general.

– March 14, 2025 – Elon Musk shared and then deleted a social media post that stated, “Stalin, Mao, and Hitler didn’t murder millions of people. Their public sector employees did.” The post came amid Musk’s cost-cutting initiatives at DOGE, which have resulted in thousands of public sector employees losing their jobs. Between six and nine million Soviets died from executions, starvation, and imprisonment under Joseph Stalin; 30–40 million people died from starvation and disease under Mao Zedong; and 11 million people died during the Holocaust under Adolf Hitler.

– March 15, 2025 – President Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan immigrants allegedly belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador without due process. In response, US District Judge James Boasberg ordered that all planes carrying immigrants covered by the proclamation return immediately to the US. However, at least one plane continued to El Salvador. “Oopsie… Too late,” Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, posted on social media above a headline about Boasberg’s order. In total, 261 immigrants were deported to El Salvador, more than half via the proclamation. Several relatives of the men deported said their family members had no ties to the gang Tren de Aragua, and neither the US nor Salvadoran government has offered any evidence of the deportees’ gang affiliations. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been invoked three times in history and only against citizens of hostile enemy governments during declared wars.

– March 17, 2025 – District Judge James E. Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration ignored his court order regarding planes carrying alleged gang members to El Salvador. In a verbal ruling, Boasberg directed the planes to return to the United States after he issued a restraining order blocking deportations that stemmed from Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The deportees were suspected members of the Tren de Arugua Venezuelan gang. Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli contended that only Boasberg’s short written order, issued after he made the verbal demand, counted. In response, Boasberg said, “I will memorialize this in a written order since apparently my oral orders don’t seem to carry much weight.”

– March 17, 2025 – In its effort to target agencies tied to foreign assistance work, the Trump administration fired the majority of the board of the US Institute of Peace (USIP). Members of Elon Musk’s DOGE entered the building with FBI agents after standoffs with USIP. Fired USIP president and CEO George Moose said, “What has happened here today is an illegal takeover by elements of the executive branch of a private nonprofit.” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly declared, “Rogue bureaucrats will not be allowed to hold agencies hostage.” Part of USIP’s stated mission is to “keep America safe, reducing the risk that the United States will be drawn into costly foreign wars that drive terrorism, criminal gangs, and migration.”

– March 18, 2025 – An article about Baseball Hall of Famer and Civil Rights hero Jackie Robinson’s military career was removed from the Department of Defense’s website as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on DEI-related material. Robinson’s wasn’t the only page to be removed. One celebrating Ira Hayes, a Native American marine who was one of the soldiers holding the American flag in the famous WWII picture at Iwo Jima, and another page about Native American code talkers were also deleted. Defense Department spokesperson Sean Parnell defended the removals: “I think the president and the secretary have been very clear on this—that anybody that says in the Department of Defense that diversity is our strength is, is frankly, incorrect.” ESPN baseball writer Jeff Passan slammed the removal of Robinson’s page: “The ghouls who did this should be ashamed. Jackie Robinson was the embodiment of an American hero. Fix this now.” Hours later, the Jackie Robinson page on the DoD’s website was restored.

– March 18, 2025 – The New York Times reported that the Trump administration wanted to “cripple the left” through executive orders, investigations, and public misinformation. It’s a plan to follow through on Trump’s campaign vow to seek “retribution” against his political enemies. Cole Leiter, executive director of Americans Against Government Censorship, said the Trump administration was seeking “to cut the legs out from their opposition.”

– March 18, 2025 – DOGE’s freeze on government spending severely affected the Food and Drug Administration’s studies and food testing programs. The lack of funding prevented the FDA from buying food to perform routine tests for pathogens. It also halted a study on bacteria in baby formula. Darin Detwiler, a food safety consultant and associate professor at Northeastern University, said, “It’s as if someone, without enough information, has said, ‘What’s a good way to save money on our automobiles? Let’s just take out the seat belts and airbags, because do we really need them?’”

– March 18, 2025 – ProPublica reported that before the Trump administration laid off nearly seven thousand IRS workers for “poor performance” on February 20, an IRS lawyer warned that the language used in the termination letter was fraudulent. Joseph Rillotta sent emails to Trump’s staff saying that no performance reviews had been considered when terminating the thousands of employees. “[I’m] pleading with you to remove the clause,” Rillota wrote. “It is not an immaterial false statement, because it is designed to improve the government’s posture in litigation (to the detriment of the employees that we are terminating today).” His email and a follow-up email were ignored by Trump’s staff.

– March 18, 2025 – Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked Donald Trump’s call to impeach a federal judge. Roberts’ reproach came after Trump demanded the removal of District Judge James E. Boasberg, who ruled against his recent deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. On Truth Social, Trump ranted, “HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!” In response, Chief Justice Roberts stated, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”

– March 18, 2025 – In an interview with Fox News, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested an unorthodox and potentially dangerous method for dealing with the bird flu. Since 2022, over 166 million chickens have been affected by the highly contagious disease. Kennedy said farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds that are immune to it.” Veterinary scientists weren’t too keen on RFK Jr.’s strategy. “That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas. If the bird flu were allowed to spread, the virus would mutate thousands of times over, killing even more birds and put other animals and potentially humans in danger. “It’s a recipe for disaster,” Hansen added.

– March 19, 2025 – In a phone call with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “agreed to Russia’s offer of a mutual pause in attacks on energy targets” for thirty days. During the call, Trump suggested the US could take control of Ukrainian power plants. White House officials said, “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.” Trump described the conversation with Zelenskyy as “very good” and peace talks were “very much on track.” The call with Zelenskyy followed an overnight Russian attack that included strikes on energy facilities.

– March 20, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the US Department of Education. Trump sat in the East Room of the White House surrounded by children at school desks. He approached several children and asked them, “Should I do it?” After Trump signed the order, he remarked, “Sounds strange doesn’t it? Department of Education. We’re going to eliminate it.” Since its founding in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, the department’s regulatory role has advocated for students with disabilities and low-income students. The department also enforced student civil rights laws. Only an act of Congress can abolish a cabinet agency.

– March 20, 2025 – Appearing on the billionaire-hosted All-In Podcast, billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that only someone committing fraud would complain about not receiving their monthly Social Security check. “Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month—my mother-in-law, who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain,” Lutnick said. “Anybody who’s been in the payment system and the processes, who knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen because whoever screams is the one stealing.” The secretary’s words stoked more concern that Trump and Musk’s DOGE plan to make drastic changes to the Social Security Administration (SSA). Earlier in the week, the SSA announced it was changing their identity verification process, which could make it harder for older Americans to access their benefits. The government also plans to shutter many SSA buildings and lay off thousands of employees. Representative James Clyburn (D-SC) responded on X to Lutnick’s bizarre statement: “The billionaires in the Trump administration have no idea what it’s like to rely on Social Security earned through a lifetime of hard, honest work.”

– March 21, 2025 – The Trump administration said it would suspend $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its policy on transgender athletes. The White House’s response on the Elon Musk–owned social media platform X said the decision was made over Penn’s policy of “forcing women to compete with men in sports.” The suspension reflected Trump’s recent executive order. Penn had made news over the case of Lia Thomas, who competed for the men’s swim team before transitioning. In 2022, she became the first transgender woman to win a major collegiate swimming title. Lia said, “People will say, ‘Oh, she just transitioned so she would have an advantage, so she could win.’ I transitioned to be happy, to be true to myself.”

– March 21, 2025 – As more information emerged about the roughly two hundred Venezuelans who were deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador for allegedly being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, it was revealed that many of the them had no history of gang affiliation or, in some cases, no criminal record at all. Lawyers and relatives of the deportees said they were accused largely based on their tattoos. One man, Jerce Reyes Barrios, who had entered the United States legally in 2024, had a tattoo of the logo of Real Madrid, his favorite soccer team. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the tattoo was evidence of his affiliation with the Tren de Aragua gang. But according to Ronna Risquez, an expert on Venezuelan gang activity who wrote a book about the Tren de Aragua gang, “Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos.”

– March 21, 2025 – Paul Weiss, a prominent law firm known for its civil rights work, conceded to pressure from the White House after Trump signed an executive order, which sought to hinder the firm’s security clearance and ban their lawyers from stepping foot in federal buildings. Trump’s order was seen as another attempt to seek retribution against his political opponents, as Paul Weiss has served many Democratic clients. As part of the agreement, the firm promised to end its DEI policies and give $40 million in free legal services to the Trump administration. Many associates at other high-power law firms signed a letter urging their employers to take a stand against the government. Rachel Cohen, an associate at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom, resigned over her employer’s inaction. “This is not what I saw for my career… but Paul Weiss’ decision to cave to the Trump administration on DEI, representation, and staffing has forced my hand,” she wrote. “We do not have time. It is either now or never, and if it’s never, I will not continue to work here.” Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, lamented on X, “Paul Weiss is merely rearranging the proverbial deck chairs on the Titanic. With this administration, there will be no legitimate legal system and no need for actual lawyers.”

– March 21, 2025 – Columbia University announced it would agree to all of the Trump administration’s demands regarding student protests and monitoring antisemitism on campus. On March 13, the White House sent a letter to the university threatening to pull $400 million in federal grants until it complied. The university said it would change its policies around student protests, including banning masks during protests, and hiring an administrator to oversee courses that teach about Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies to make sure “the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced.” A day earlier, several faculty members of the university’s history department sent a signed letter warning the school against agreeing to the government’s terms, comparing the Trump administration’s actions to “authoritarian regimes” that have sought control over academic institutions. As of March 24, 2025, it was not known whether Columbia’s capitulation would free up their federal grant money. However, Leo Terrell, a senior Justice Department lawyer, said the university still had much more to do to get it. “Columbia has not, in my opinion—and the opinion of the Department of Justice—cleaned up their act,” he said. “They’re not even close, not even close to having those funds unfrozen.”

– March 21, 2025 – Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that airplane manufacturer Boeing won the contract to build the “next generation” of fighter jets for the US military. The new planes would be called F-47’s. Trump said generals picked the title, and it’s a beautiful number." He also added that U.S. allies were interested in buying the aircraft and that the US would likely sell them “toned down” versions “because someday, maybe they’re not our allies.” In 2024, DOGE head Elon Musk told senior leaders. in the United States military that “manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones.” He called those who built the F-35 and F-47 idiots.

March 22, 2025 – Trump attacked Maine Governor Janet Mills again over her state’s transgender athlete policies. In a Truth Social post, the president of the United States demanded an apology from Mills and implied that the government would pull funding for the state until she apologized for their confrontation in February. “While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases,” Trump wrote in an early Saturday morning post. “Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again before this case can be settled.” It is unclear what “case” the president referred to. In response to their clash at the Governors’ Conference, Mills said, “In my conversation with the President last week, unfortunately, he made a statement that I have never heard any president say before, that he is the law… It’s like Louis the XIV.”

– March 21, 2025 – The Department of Homeland Security revoked temporary legal protections for over 500,000 Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans who came to the US for urgent humanitarian reasons. The protections were part of a Biden administration program that created renewable “legal pathways” for individuals to come to the US, provided they passed security checks and had financial sponsors. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said these temporary residents would lose their legal status on April 2. In the Federal Register, she wrote that the administration ended the program because it had no “significant benefit.” Recently, Trump considered whether to cancel the temporary legal status of 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia.

– March 24, 2025 – Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, revealed that he was accidentally included in a group chat where top Trump administration officials posted about “operational details of forthcoming strikes in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.” The emoji-filled chat took place on Signal, a commercial messaging app, and included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and other top officials. National security lawyers stated that the chat may have violated provisions of the Espionage Act; the messages were also set to disappear, possibly violating federal records laws. “This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Hillary Clinton, who was heavily criticized for using a private email server as secretary of state, added: “You have got to be kidding me.”

– March 24, 2025 – Yunseo Chung, a legal permanent resident who has lived in the US since 
childhood, sued the Trump administration after ICE attempted to arrest and deport her. 
The Department of Homeland Security stated that Chung had “engaged in concerning conduct, 
including when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College” 
and that she was “being sought for removal proceedings under the immigration laws.” A 
Columbia University student, Chung attended a pro-Palestinian student sit-in on March 
5 and was arrested by police on misdemeanor charges of obstructing a government building. 
Several days after Chung’s release, ICE showed up at Chung’s parents’ home and began 
texting her. Federal prosecutors subsequently informed Chung that her legal permanent 
residency was being “revoked,” and her university housing was also searched. “It can’t 
be the case that a straight-A student who has lived here most of her life can be 
whisked away and potentially deported,” said Naz Ahmad, codirector of CLEAR legal 
clinic and one of Chung’s lawyers. “All because she dares to speak up.”

– March 25, 2025 – Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, was 
detained by Department of Homeland Security agents despite having a valid student visa 
and no criminal charges filed against her. Surveillance video showed six plainclothes 
officers approach Ozturk on the street, restrain her, and then hide their faces. At the 
time of her arrest, Ozturk, who is Muslim and wears a head covering, was headed to a 
Ramadan break fast with friends. Without access to her medication, she suffered an 
asthma attack en route to a detention center in Louisiana. A senior DHS spokesperson 
said that Ozturk had “engaged in activities in support of Hamas” without providing any 
details or evidence. Ozturk’s friends and colleagues pushed back against DHS’s 
characterization: “She doesn’t drive, but if she was to drive she wouldn’t even have 
a parking ticket. That’s the kind of person we’re talking about,” said Reyyan Bilge, 
a psychology professor at Northeastern. In March 2024, Ozturk cowrote an opinion 
essay in The Tufts Daily criticizing Tufts’ response to student demands to “acknowledge 
the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies connected to Israel.

– March 25, 2025 – Following a social media meltdown, a portrait of President Trump was removed from the Colorado Capitol, where it had hung for the past six years. Over the weekend, Trump had railed against the oil painting portrait on Truth Social, calling it “purposefully distorted” and “truly the worst.” In the same post, Trump accused the artist of “[losing] her talent as she got older” and blamed the portrait on Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, despite the fact the portrait was funded, commissioned, and unveiled by Republicans. A spokeswoman for the governor stated that Polis was “surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork.”

– March 25, 2025 – President Trump signed an executive order requiring proof of US citizenship to vote and that all ballots be received by Election Day. In the past, Trump has repeatedly made false statements about noncitizens voting and mail-in voter fraud. After losing the 2020 election, he falsely blamed voter fraud, describing the election as “rigged,” “stolen,” and “a hoax.” “We have a rigged election. We have bad borders, we have very bad elections. We have a bad voting system. We have mail-in ballots,” Trump said in a 2024 interview. In fact, voter fraud is exceedingly rare, and stricter voting requirements may disenfranchise citizens without easy access to the necessary documents or who cannot vote in person on Election Day. “This measure will no doubt disproportionately impact historically-excluded communities,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, “including voters of color, naturalized citizens, people with disabilities, and the elderly, by pushing unnecessary barriers to the fundamental right.”

– March 25, 2025 – President Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Devon Archer, who testified to Congress about Hunter Biden’s business dealings. One of Biden’s former business partners, Archer testified that Hunter Biden had used “soft power” and his association with President Joe Biden to influence his business dealings, earning Archer a following among conservatives. Before signing the pardon, Trump said Archer was “a victim of a crime” and “was treated very unfairly.” In 2022, Archer was convicted of fraud and sentenced to a year-and-a-day prison term, which had yet to commence. With the pardon, Archer will not be required to pay the forfeitures or restitution, and he will not serve a single day in prison.

– March 25, 2025 – Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar,” acknowledged that “collaterals” were swept up in a recent ICE operation that took place in Boston over six days and resulted in 370 arrests. “Most were criminals, but many were collaterals. A majority criminals. How come the collaterals? I’ve said this a thousand times. Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the community and more collateral arrests.” Pressed for more details by reporters, Homan added, “I don’t have the numbers.” In a statement, ICE noted that only 205 of the 370 people arrested had a criminal history. Gladys Vega, president of La Colaborativa, a social services organization for Latinx immigrants, noted the devastating impact of the raids on her community: “It’s creating panic, it’s creating a situation where the fear is taking over, and people are not showing up to doctor’s appointments, they’re not showing up to school, they’re not going in huge numbers to the church.”

– March 25, 2025 – In a video posted to social media, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posed in front of an overcrowded prison cell at El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT. Earlier in the month, the Trump administration deported hundreds of migrants to CECOT without due process and without evidence that the men were tied to gangs or had committed crimes. In the video, the inmates’ heads were shaved, and many did not have shirts; the men were stacked on three levels of bunks, with multiple men crammed to a bunk and standing room only on the ground. “I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face,” said Noem, who wore a gold $50,000 Rolex and what appeared to be strip lashes and hair extensions in the video.

– March 25, 2025 – In his opening remarks at a White House Women’s History Month event, Trump said, “We’re ending the Marxist war on women. You had a war on women. And we’re protecting women’s rights, defending women’s dignity and standing up for the American moms and daughters.” Hours after taking office in January, the Trump administration took the website www.reproductiverights.gov offline. Trump also eliminated the Gender Policy Council, expressed opposition to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and supported proposed cuts to Medicaid. One in ten women in the US relies on Medicaid for health coverage, including pregnancy-related care, family planning, screening for breast and cervical cancer, and long-term care services and support.

– March 27, 2025 – The Trump administration announced a new 25 percent tariff on auto imports to boost domestic manufacturing. “This will continue to spur growth,” Trump told reporters. “Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for.” On news of the new tariff, General Motors stock fell nearly 7 percent. Noted economist Arthur Laffer, who Trump awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019, said in a twenty-one-page analysis that the tariffs could add well over four thousand dollars to the cost of a car for American consumers. Economist Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said, “We’re going to see reduced choice. These kinds of taxes fall more heavily on the middle and working class.’’ Several days after the tariff announcement, Trump admitted he “couldn’t care less” if auto makers raised their prices

– March 27, 2025 – Ten thousand federal employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were laid off by the Trump administration. HHS manages the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, “This Department will do more—a lot more—at a lower cost to the taxpayer.” Responding to the layoffs, Dr. Chris Pernell, director of the NAACP’s Center for Health Equity said, “Any reduction in our public health infrastructure—whether it’s workers or funding—only serves to make Americans sicker. And we know that when America gets a cold, Black people get the flu.”

– March 27, 2025 – Trump issued an executive order called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” The order aimed to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution and its National Museum of African American History and Culture. Vice President JD Vance was charged with eliminating programs that advanced “divisive narratives” and “improper ideology.” The order stated that the Smithsonian promoted “a divisive, race-centered ideology” and “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.” In 2017, Trump visited the museum and declared, “I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture, and the unbreakable American spirit.”

– March 28, 2025 – During a contentious trip to Greenland, Vice President JD Vance said, “Denmark has not kept pace and devoted the resources necessary to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and other nations.” He offered no details of the alleged incursions. The United States has had a military base on Greenland since 1951 and is required to defend the country as a member of NATO. Vance’s speech in Nuuk coincided with the Trump administration’s desire to acquire the Danish territory. Trump stated that he “won’t take anything off the table” to procure the island. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post, “President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland.’ Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else.”

– March 29, 2025 – More than two hundred “Tesla Takedown” rallies took place in cities around the world. Protest organizers discouraged people from buying Teslas or selling off their Tesla stock. The rallies also voiced opposition to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. In the days leading up to the protests, Musk’s department had already slashed US federal budgets and laid off thousands of workers. Manissa Maharawal, an assistant professor at American University who studied anti-tech protests, pointed out that “the hypocrisy is so deep. Tesla has received billions in government funding.” In San Francisco, one protester featured a sign with a photograph of Musk and a caption that read, THIS IS THE IMMIGRANT WHO TOOK YOUR JOB.

– March 30, 2025 – In a court filing, the Trump administration admitted that it had mistakenly deported a Maryland man with protected legal status, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador on March 15. “Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the filing acknowledged. Trump administration lawyers went on to state that the US courts have no jurisdiction to order Abrego Garcia’s return; they asked that the court dismiss Abrego Garcia’s request that the Trump administration call for his return and withhold payment to the Salvadoran government on the grounds that Trump’s “primacy in foreign affairs” took priority over the interests of Abrego Garcia and his family. Married to a US citizen and the father of a five-year-old disabled child, Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the US and was granted a protected legal status in 2019 due to his likelihood of facing harm if deported back to his home country.

– March 30, 2025 – During an interview with NBC News, President Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third presidential term “There are methods which you could do it,” he said, acknowledging that one possible route would involve Vice President JD Vance running for president and then passing the role to Trump. In the past, Trump has frequently joked or speculated about running for a third term; in February, he likened himself to a king. The Twenty-Second Amendment to the US Constitution explicitly bans a president from being elected to more than two terms.

– March 30, 2025 – The Trump administration deported seventeen more men to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. Although officials claimed the men were deported under regular immigration law rather than under the controversial Alien Enemies Act of 1798, both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pentagon Chief of Staff Joe Kasper still described the deportations as “counterterrorism” operations. In a statement released the following day, Rubio described the deportees as “violent criminals from the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 organizations, including murderers and rapists.” The administration did not provide detailed information about the identities of the deportees, their alleged crimes, or the legal authority under which they were removed. The Trump administration has faced significant criticism and multiple lawsuits over its handling of earlier deportations to El Salvador and the possibility that it defied a judge’s order. Family members of those deported earlier in the month said their relatives were not gang members and were denied due process. The Trump administration also acknowledged that at least one man was mistakenly deported due to “administrative error.”

– March 30, 2025 – At a rally in Green Bay, Elon Musk gave two Wisconsin voters $1 
million checks and promised additional smaller payments to those who help elect 
conservative Brad Schimel to the State Supreme Court. In a video posted by Elon Musk’s 
America PAC, one of the recipients, Ekaterina Deistler, explicitly linked her payment to 
following Musk’s instructions to vote. “I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to 
do: sign the petition, refer friends and family, vote, and now I have a million 
dollars,” said Deistler. The cash giveaways came after Musk previously offered voters 
one hundred dollars to sign a petition denouncing “activist judges.” Earlier in the day, 
the Wisconsin Supreme Court had declined to accept a lawsuit from the attorney general 
arguing that Musk’s actions violated anti-bribery laws. Musk and affiliated groups have 
spent over $20 million on the race, which they have argued will impact congressional 
redistricting. “Whichever party controls the House to a significant degree controls 
the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization,” said Musk. According 
to The New York Times, Musk began directing money to the Wisconsin judicial race shortly 
after Tesla sued Wisconsin over laws prohibiting auto manufacturers from selling 
directly to consumers.

– March 31, 2025 – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jason Galanis, whose congressional testimony last year aided Republican efforts to impeach former president Joe Biden. When asked to explain the commutation, a senior White House official mentioned Galanis’s contribution to the impeachment investigation. A former business associate of Hunter Biden, Galanis pled guilty to two securities fraud schemes and was sentenced to over fifteen years in prison and $162 million in forfeiture and restitution. The commutation eliminated Galanis’s unpaid financial penalties. “He and his codefendants engaged in market manipulation and the defrauding of shareholders, and they stole a large portion of the proceeds of tribal bonds that were intended to fund economic development projects,” said Audrey Strauss, the former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, after Galanis’s sentencing.

– March 31, 2025 – Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. announced they were joining with Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 to create a new firm called American Bitcoin. Twenty percent of American Bitcoin will be controlled by American Data Centers, whose investors include both Trump sons, and Eric Trump was listed as cofounder and chief strategy officer of the new firm. According to government ethics experts, the Trump family’s crypto dealings are a major conflict of interest. During his campaign, Donald Trump and his sons launched World Liberty Financial, which offers two types of digital currencies, and on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Donald Trump and Melania Trump launched a memecoin. As president, Trump has eased up on prosecuting crypto crime and created a national stockpile of digital currencies, an action widely viewed as a boon to crypto investors.

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes
February 2025: Atrocities 23-68
by Emily Greenberg and Cliff Mayotte
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-spinning number of misdeeds coming from his administration. We called this list a collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s second term.

FEBRUARY 2025
– February 1, 2025 – President Trump signed executive orders imposing tariffs on Canada, 
China, and Mexico. The tariffs aimed to curb the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the 
country. He claimed the three countries were allowing “mass numbers of people to come in 
and fentanyl to come in.” The executive orders sidestepped congressional approval, and 
Trump acknowledged there could be “some pain” in the form of higher inflation, job 
losses, and stagnating growth due to the tariffs. The Wall Street Journal called Trump’s 
plan “the dumbest trade war in history.”

– February 3, 2025 – Trump ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to release 2.2 billion 
gallons of water from two reservoirs in central California. Local officials scrambled 
to prepare as communities were threatened of being inundated. On Truth Social, Trump 
crowed, “The water is flowing in California… and heading to farmers throughout the 
State, and to Los Angeles. Too bad they refused to do this during my First Term—There 
would have been no fires!” Neither reservoir was connected to aqueducts serving the 
southern part of the state. “Those releases had absolutely zero to do with anything in 
Los Angeles,” said Gregory Pierce, director of UCLA’s Water Resource Group. “This was 
a stunt purely so Trump could say that he did something.”

– February 3, 2025 – Trump announced the United States would cut aid to South Africa 
over their recent land expropriation law. On Truth Social, Trump posted, “South Africa 
is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.” Trump’s 
talking points mirrored those of South Africa–born billionaire Elon Musk. In 2023, 
Musk said, “They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.” 
White South Africans, who make up about 7 percent of the population, continue to 
dominate land ownership and occupy almost 50 percent of South Africa’s surface area.

– February 4, 2025 – During a White House press conference with Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump said that Palestinians should leave war-ravaged Gaza 
and settle elsewhere. He also announced that the United States would take over the 
territory and redevelop it into “the Riviera of the Middle East.” Trump didn’t rule 
out deploying US troops and offered no other details on how the 1.8 million residents 
of the Gaza Strip would be resettled or how the US would take ownership of the land. 
Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them children, during the Israel-
Hamas conflict.

– February 5, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order banning transgender women and 
girls from participating in women’s sports. “Who could forget last year’s Paris 
Olympics, where a male boxer stole the woman’s gold medal after brutalizing his 
female opponent?” Trump said, repeating a false claim about a female boxer from 
Algeria, where it is illegal for people to change their gender. “From now on,” he 
said, “women’s sports will be only for women.” During a congressional hearing in 
December 2024, NCAA President Charlie Baker said there were fewer than ten 
transgender athletes among the 510,000 competing at US schools.

– February 6, 2025 – Trump posted on Truth Social that “billions of dollars” from 
USAID had improperly gone to the media company Politico, which he considers “fake 
news.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated his claim during a press 
conference. “I was made aware of the funding from USAID to media outlets, including 
Politico,” she said. Government agencies used funding to subscribe to Politico Pro, 
a service that tracks legislation and other policy information. According to USA 
Spending.gov, USAID paid $24,000 to Politico Pro in 2024 for a subscription to E&E, 
an energy and environmental news service owned by the company.

– February 7, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order to eliminate “anti-Christian 
bias” in the federal government. “If we don’t have religious liberty,” he said 
during a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, “then we don’t have a free country. 
We probably don’t even have a country.” He appointed Attorney General Pam Bondi to 
lead a task force that would “fully prosecute anti-Christian violence.” In response, 
the Interfaith Alliance stated, “We fear that this task force will aid organizations 
looking to circumvent anti-discrimination laws under the guise of religious freedom… 
There is no evidence of widespread anti-Christian bias in the United States.”

– February 7, 2025 – Trump’s January 20 executive order stated “illegal aliens” are 
“presenting significant threats to national security and public safety.” Recent 
interviews conducted by California nonprofit Cal Matters suggested that some people 
arrested in Trump’s immigration crackdown were not hardened criminals. Loreal Duran 
of Echo Park recounted her husband’s arrest. “It was just a regular morning,” she 
said, as her husband, Giovanni Duran, was getting ready to drive their children to 
school. Giovanni came to California from El Salvador without federal authorization 
when he was two years old. He worked as a busser in a sushi restaurant in Los 
Angeles before he was taken into custody. Loreal’s seven-year-old son asked, “Did 
Daddy get arrested because he’s brown?” A recent report said
that less than half of the approximately 8,200 people arrested from January 20 
through February 2 had criminal convictions.

– February 8, 2025 – Employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) were 
told to cease “all supervision and examination activity” and “all stakeholder 
engagement” via an email from newly appointed Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget Russell Vought. A White House statement claimed the CFPB “has long 
functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its 
power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called elites.” 
The CFPB is an independent agency created after the collapse of the US banking system 
in 2008, which left Americans with massive financial losses and raised questions about 
the operations of the country’s major financial institutions.

– February 9, 2025 – After two weeks on the lam, a man recently pardoned by President 
Trump for his role in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack was arrested again, this 
time on old charges of soliciting a minor. Thirty-six-year-old Andrew Taake allegedly 
sent sexually explicit messages to an undercover officer posing as a teenage girl in 
2016. In 2023, he pled guilty to assaulting officers with bear spray and a metal whip 
during the Capitol attack and was sentenced to six years in prison. According to Trump, 
his mass pardon of individuals such as Taake convicted of crimes related to the Capitol 
attack ended “a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American 
people.”

– February 9, 2025 – “I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state 
because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I’m not going to let that happen,” 
Trump said during an interview with Fox News on Super Bowl Sunday. He claimed Canada was 
not viable as a country and would be much better off as a fifty-first state. “Mr. Trump 
has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country, and it is a real 
thing,” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “They’re very aware of our 
resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”

– February 9, 2025 – As Air Force One flew over the Gulf of Mexico en route to Super 
Bowl LIX in New Orleans, Trump signed a proclamation designating February 9 as “Gulf 
of America Day,” following up on his earlier executive order directing the secretary 
of the interior to rename the Gulf of Mexico. During remarks at Mar-a-Lago on January 
7, Trump announced his intentions to change the name and explained his motivations for 
doing so. “[Mexico is] essentially run by cartels. Mexico’s really in trouble, a lot of 
trouble, very dangerous place. We’re going to change [that] because we do most of the 
work there,” he continued, “and it’s ours. It’s appropriate, and Mexico has to stop 
allowing millions of people to pour into our country. They can stop them.” Comedian 
Stephen Colbert first used the term “Gulf of America” satirically, following the 2010 
Deepwater Horizon oil spill, joking that “we broke it, we bought it.” In 2012, 
Democratic State Representative Stephen Holland introduced a satiric bill proposing 
the name change to draw attention to Republican anti-immigration efforts.

– February 9, 2025 – During the same flight to the Super Bowl, Trump—whose real estate 
failures have resulted in multiple bankruptcy filings—described Gaza as a “big real 
estate site” for the US to “own” and “redevelop”: “I think that it’s a big mistake 
to allow people—the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza—to go back yet another 
time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, 
and the United States is going to own it… and develop it. We’re going to bring 
stability to the Middle East.” With only a few exceptions for security and military 
reasons, forced displacement of civilians is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.

– February 10, 2025 – Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove directed federal 
prosecutors to dismiss charges against New York City mayor Eric Adams without 
prejudice. In his memo to the Southern District of New York, Bove argued that 
continued prosecution of Adams would interfere with the mayor’s ability to enforce 
the Trump administration’s immigration agenda and noted that the order to dismiss 
was made “without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on 
which the case is based.” Adams, who spent months currying favor with Trump, was 
indicted in September 2024 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, soliciting illegal 
campaign contributions from foreign nationals, and bribery.

– February 10, 2025 – President Trump pardoned former Democratic Illinois Governor 
Rod Blagojevich after first commuting his sentence during his first term. In 2010, 
Blagojevich was convicted on seventeen corruption and pay-to-play charges—including 
an attempt to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama—and sentenced to fourteen 
years in prison, of which he served only eight. During Blagojevich’s trial, 
prosecutors presented a recording of Blagojevich in which the former governor, 
referring to the Senate seat, said, “I mean, I’ve got this thing, and it’s fucking 
golden. And I’m just not giving it up for fucking nothing.” After Blagojevich’s 
indictment, he appeared on Donald Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice, where the future 
president praised his “tremendous courage and guts.”

– February 10, 2025 – President Trump signed an executive order to end “the procurement 
and forced use of paper straws.” “These things don’t work,” Trump told reporters. “I’ve 
had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode. If something’s hot, 
they don’t last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds. 
It’s a ridiculous situation.” Single-use plastics negatively impact both the environment 
and human health. Brushing off environmental concerns, Trump, who is reportedly obsessed 
with and terrified of sharks, added, “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect a 
shark as they’re eating, as they’re munching their way through the ocean.”

– February 10, 2025 – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that US Army base Fort 
Liberty be renamed Fort Bragg, its original name. “That’s right, Bragg is back,” said 
Hegseth. Originally named after slave-owning Confederate General Braxton Bragg, the 
North Carolina base was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023 following racial justice protests 
and legislation forbidding the naming of bases after Confederates. Sidestepping that 
legislation, Hegseth’s memo claimed the base was named after World War II veteran 
Roland L. Bragg. However, during media appearances between 2021 and 2024, Hegseth 
repeatedly criticized efforts to remove the names of Confederates from army bases 
as “a sham,” “garbage,” and “crap.”

– February 10, 2025 – Following his purge of eighteen Biden-appointed board members, Trump became chairman of the traditionally bipartisan John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and immediately fired its longtime president. A frequent target of Kennedy Center honorees, Trump has criticized the Kennedy Center for its “woke” and queer-friendly programming. “Just last year,” he said, “the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth—THIS WILL STOP.” Although pundits have frequently described Trump as a performance artist, the president has yet to attend a Kennedy Center performance and is the only president to have skipped the Kennedy Center Honors twice. “I got reports they were so bad,” Trump said, referring to the Kennedy Center shows, “I didn’t want to go. There was nothing I wanted to see.”

– February 11, 2025 – Wearing a “Dark MAGA” hat and black T-shirt, Elon Musk made several false claims about DOGE in the Oval Office. “I don’t know of a case where an organization has been more transparent than the DOGE organization,” said Musk, who also asserted, without evidence, that USAID officials had taken “tens of millions of dollars” worth of “kickbacks.” In actuality, Musk has taken great pains to prevent DOGE staffers from being identified, refused to release his financial disclosure filing, and has not been open about when his staffers will show up at federal agencies or how his team plans to use access to payment systems. “Who is this unelected billionaire, that he can attempt to dismantle federal agencies, fire people, transfer them, offer them early retirement, and have sweeping reform or changes to agencies without any congressional review, oversight, or concurrence?” said US Representative Gerald Connolly. When questioned about some of his previous false statements, Musk responded, ​​“Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. Nobody’s going to bat 1,000.”

– February 12, 2025 – Tulsi Gabbard was confirmed as the director of national intelligence with a 52–48 Senate vote. A veteran and former Democratic representative from Hawaii, Gabbard met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017 and has made comments sympathetic to Russia. Soon after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Gabbard wrote on social media, “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns.” As of March 2025, Russia still occupies about 20 percent of Ukraine. The war has killed an estimated 40,000 civilians, and nearly eleven million people have either fled Ukraine or are internally displaced.

– February 12, 2025 – Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. was confirmed as the Secretary of Health and Human Services with a 52–48 Senate vote. In the past, Kennedy has suggested that chemicals in the water supply can turn children gay or transgender, questioned whether HIV causes AIDS, and compared COVID-19 mandates to laws in Nazi Germany. A longtime anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy has made false statements that vaccines cause autism, reduce IQ, and increase susceptibility to flu and polio. “Nobody can tell you what the risk profile for any vaccine is,” Kennedy claimed in 2019. “So anybody who says they’re safe and effective is not telling the truth because they can’t tell you that based on science.” According to the World Health Organization, vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives over the past fifty years.

– February 13, 2025 – Acting US Attorney Danielle Sassoon resigned over the Justice Department’s order to dismiss charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams without prejudice. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Sassoon wrote that dismissing the case against Adams was “inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts” and accused the mayor’s lawyers of advocating for “what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.” Sassoon’s resignation prompted a wave of other resignations, including the departures of John Keller and Kevin Driscoll, who led the DOJ’s public integrity unit in Washington, and Hagan Scotten, the lead prosecutor in the Adams case. “Our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials,” wrote Scotten in his resignation letter. “If no lawyer within earshot of the president is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.”

– February 13, 2025 – As part DOGE’s efforts to cut spending and reduce the federal workforce, over three hundred workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees the US stockpile of nuclear weapons, were abruptly fired. “The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “Elon Musk and DOGE are playing a dangerous game,” added Senator Ed Markey. “Cutting 200 NNSA staff overnight weakens oversight and could leave our nuclear stockpile vulnerable. This isn’t smart savings—it’s dangerously irresponsible.” Following significant chaos and criticism, NNSA Acting Director Teresa Robbins was forced to rescind the terminations the following day.

– February 13, 2025 – During President Trump’s meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Agence France-Presse photographer Jim Watson snapped a photo showing a gold-framed New York Post cover featuring Trump’s mugshot hanging just outside the Oval Office. The mug shot, which Trump shared on social media with the caption “NEVER SURRENDER” and which subsequently appeared on Trump campaign merchandise, was taken in August 2023 after Trump was indicted in Fulton County on charges stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

– February 13, 2025 – The National Park Service removed references to transgender people from its Stonewall National Monument website. What used to be listed as LGBTQ+ was changed to LGB. The Stonewall Uprising in 1969 was a pivotal moment in the LGBQT+ activist movement. The Stonewall Inn released a statement in response, saying, “This blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals—especially transgender women of color—who were at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights.”

– February 14, 2025 – The New York Times reported that Trump plans to pave over the grass in the Rose Garden so that it resembles his patio at Mar-a-Lago. “The White House has not been given any tender, loving care in many decades, so President Trump is taking necessary steps in order to preserve and restore the greatness and glory of ‘the People’s House,’” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director. One of the most iconic White House settings, the Rose Garden has been used for press conferences, bill-signing ceremonies, formal dinners, and weddings.

– February 15, 2025 – Echoing a quote often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, who crowned himself French emperor in 1804, President Trump posted on social media that “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” A day later, responding to a news article about the Trump administration’s violation of a court order, Trump posted the same quote, this time overlaying an image of Napoleon. The posts followed earlier remarks in which Trump joked about becoming a dictator and argued that presidents should have immunity from criminal prosecution.

– February 17, 2025 – On President’s Day, thousands of protesters took to streets across the United States, many calling Trump a “king.” Protesters also rallied against Elon Musk’s team at the Department of Government Efficiency and their pending cuts to social services. Anita Gilmore of Maryland expressed concerns about her son’s health care coverage: “My son is on Medicaid because he has a life-threatening disease, and if I wasn’t there to take care of him, he would be one of these [DC] homeless guys on the street.”

– February 18, 2025 – Panama detained three hundred asylum-seekers who had been deported under President Trump’s orders. The detainees were held in a hotel while they waited for authorities to organize returns to their home countries. Many of the migrants didn’t want to return, due to safety concerns. One migrant attempted suicide and another broke his arm trying to escape. The White House posted a video on social media entitled “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.” The caption referred to autonomous sensory meridian response videos, which are popular online for delivering pleasant sounds that create positive and therapeutic sensations.

– February 18, 2025 – Trump called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator without elections.” Ukraine is under martial law, which under its constitution forbids the holding of elections. Trump also accused the democratically elected president of Ukraine of starting the war with Russia. “You should have never started it,” Trump said. “You could have made a deal.” Zelenskyy responded by saying, “With all due respect to President Donald Trump as a leader… he is living in a disinformation space.” Russia’s army crossed Ukraine’s border in 2022, an invasion that Putin sought to justify by claiming it was necessary to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine.

– February 20, 2025 – As part of Trump’s slashing of federal government agencies, the IRS announced it would layoff nearly seven thousand workers for “poor performance.” Many of the terminated workers were hired by the Biden administration to focus on enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. “This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is only an agency that’s really focused on the low income,” said University of Pittsburgh tax law professor Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer. “It’s a travesty.”

– February 20, 2025 – Kash Patel, an ally of President Trump and conspiracy theorist who appeared on a prominent white nationalist’s podcast eight times, was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 49 to lead the FBI. During the confirmation hearings, senators grilled Patel about his lack of law enforcement experience and expressed doubts about his ability to maintain the independence of the FBI. Patel evaded questions about whether he would investigate officials on a so-called enemies list in his book, Government Gangsters. US Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a statement saying, “Kash Patel is an extreme MAGA loyalist… He is blindly loyal to Donald Trump and Donald Trump only.”

– February 21, 2025 – Elon Musk appeared on stage at the right-wing Conservative 
Political Action Conference (CPAC) wielding a chainsaw, bragging about the cuts his Department of Government Efficiency has made, and suggesting Democrats should be charged treason for their immigration policies. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” he shouted before accusing the Biden administration of allowing immigrants into the United States so as to accrue more supporters at the polls, a conspiracy theory known as the “great replacement.” There is no evidence the former president eased immigration restrictions to allow migrant workers to vote.

– February 21, 2025 – During a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors, Trump questioned Maine’s Democratic Governor Janet Mills about complying with the executive order banning transgender athletes in women’s sports. “We are the federal law. You better comply or you’re not getting any federal funding.” Gov. Mills responded, “See you in court.” The US Department of Education promptly informed Maine they were under a “directed investigation.” In a statement, Gov. Mills said, “Do not be misled: This is not just about who can compete on the athletic field, this is about whether a president can force compliance with his will, without regard for the rule of law.”

– February 22, 2025 – Trump addressed members of CPAC and boasted about firing thousands of federal workers, and dismantling USAID, the government’s main international development agency. “We have escorted the radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and have locked the doors behind them.” He also praised the January 6 insurrectionists in attendance, calling them “political prisoners and J6 hostages.” Among those pardoned was Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, who had been convicted of seditious conspiracy. The day before Trump’s address at CPAC, Tarrio was arrested on assault charges.

– February 24, 2025 – The United States voted against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukrainian territory. The United States also abstained from voting on its own competing resolution calling for an end to the war after other countries added three amendments replacing “the Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation,” acknowledging Ukraine’s territorial rights, and calling for a “lasting” peace. President Trump has falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator.

– February 24, 2025 – Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, attacked so-called sanctuary cities during a speech at CPAC. He singled out Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox, in particular, and falsely accused him of refusing to work with ICE to deport illegal immigrants. “You’re not a police commissioner,” Homan shouted from the podium. “Take that badge off your desk, put it in your desk drawer—because you became a politician. You forgot what it’s like to be a cop.” In an interview earlier in the week, Cox said Boston police officers would help ICE detain illegal criminals who have committed crimes but would not work with the federal government to arrest immigrants solely for immigration reasons. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu defended Cox. “It’s insulting. We have the best police commissioner in the country. Boston’s crime levels are at the lowest ever reported in our history,” she said. “I’m coming to Boston, I’m bringing Hell with me,” Homan threatened to massive cheers from the CPAC crowd. As of March 17, 2025, Homan had yet to come to Boston.

– February 24, 2025 – The US State Department ordered officials to deny visas to transgender athletes traveling to the US for sports events and to issue permanent visa bans against individuals who have “misrepresented” their sex on visa applications. The State Department order follows Trump’s earlier executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. While signing that executive order, Trump stated that he had told Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make clear to the International Olympic Committee that “America categorically rejects transgender lunacy.” “It’s normal to say that people accused of fraud or misrepresentation are often considered ineligible,” said Sarah Mehta, an ACLU policy lawyer, “but it is quite bizarre and novel in a terrible way to be saying it’s based on their misrepresenting their sex or gender in order to come and participate in an event in the United States.”

– February 25, 2025 – Breaking with decades of precedent, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump administration would select which journalists participate in the White House press pool. “We’re going to be calling those shots,” added Trump. The announcement followed the administration’s retaliatory barring of Associated Press journalists after the AP refused to comply with Trump’s order that the Gulf of Mexico, which mostly lies outside maritime regions controlled by the United States, be called the Gulf of America. “This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president. In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps,” said Eugene Daniels, a Politico reporter and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association.

– February 25, 2025 – Trump posted an AI-generated video showing Gaza transformed into a luxury resort featuring golden Trump statues and balloons. In the video, war-ravaged children emerge from rubble onto glittering beaches with belly dancers and palm trees, a smiling Elon Musk eats hummus, and Trump lounges on the beach with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while a voice sings, “No more tunnels, no more fear. Trump Gaza is finally here.” The video follows Trump’s earlier statements about taking over Gaza, expelling its Palestinian residents, and developing the Palestinian territory into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” “The video advocating for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza published on President Trump’s social media is not only arrogant and disrespectful,” said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian activist and politician, “but also violates international law and human rights.”

– February 25, 2025 – An unvaccinated child with no underlying health conditions died from measles in rural West Texas. It was the first such US death since 2015 and the first such US death of a child since 2003. As of March 4, 2025, the Texas measles outbreak had risen to over 150 cases. Vaccination rates in Gaines County, where the outbreak began, are especially low. During a Cabinet meeting, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, downplayed the Texas measles outbreak, saying, “It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.” Several days later, in an opinion piece for Fox News, Kennedy stopped short of explicitly recommending the MMR vaccine, calling the decision to vaccinate a “personal” choice and advocating for vitamin A treatment, which experts have recommended against using in most measles cases.

– February 25, 2025 – Trump said that the United States would soon offer a new visa program to help attract foreign investors to the country. “We are going to be selling a gold card,” he said. “We are going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million. It’s going to give you green card privileges plus its going to be a route to [American] citizenship.” When asked if Russian oligarchs would be eligible, Trump said, “Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”

– February 26, 2025 – Despite not being a Cabinet secretary, Elon Musk attended Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting and defended his cost-cutting efforts at DOGE. Wearing a black “tech support” T-shirt and knocking on his “wooden head,” Musk said he hoped to trim $1 trillion from the federal budget while also acknowledging, with a chuckle, that he had accidentally cancelled Ebola prevention. When questioned about his order that government workers send an email summarizing their accomplishments for the week, a directive that caused significant confusion and was widely criticized, Musk repeated a baseless claim that some workers collecting federal paychecks are either fictional or dead.

– February 26, 2025 – The Trump administration terminated funding for thousands of global health projects, including programs for polio, HIV, malaria, and maternal health. The State Department announced the terminations over email, writing, “This award is being terminated for convenience and the interest of the U.S. government.” USAID experts warned that the cuts will lead to an estimated 166,000 malaria deaths, 200,000 polio paralyses in children, 28,000 new cases of infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg, and one million children not treated for severe malnutrition, which is often fatal, annually. “People will die,” said Dr. Catherine Kyobutungi, executive director of the African Population and Health Research Center, “but we will never know because even the programs to count the dead are cut.”

– February 27, 2025 – In a Truth Social post, Trump encouraged Iowa lawmakers to approve a bill ending state civil rights protections for transgender Iowans. “Iowa, a beautiful State that I have won BIG every time, has a Bill to remove Radical Gender Ideology from their Laws,” he wrote. “Iowa should follow the lead of my Executive Order, saying there are only two genders, and pass this Bill – AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.” The bill, which was approved and then signed by Governor Kim Reynolds, removes gender identity as a protected class, allowing employers, businesses, and landlords to discriminate against transgender people. In a 2023 survey, more than 60 percent of transgender adults said they have faced discrimination because of their gender identity.

– February 28, 2025 – During a televised Oval Office meeting, President Trump and Vice President Vance lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy and threatened to abandon Ukraine. After Zelenskyy expressed doubts about an American-brokered peace deal with Russia, the vice president called the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful,” adding, “You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.” As the meeting continued, Trump and Vance raised their voices, interrupted Zelenskyy, and pointed fingers at him. “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,” said Trump. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.”

Lest We Forget the Horrors: An Unending Catalog of Trump’s Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes
January 2025: Atrocities 1-22
by Emily Greenberg and Cliff Mayotte
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
      
Early in President Trump’s first term, McSweeney’s editors began to catalog the head-
spinning number of misdeeds coming from his administration. We called this list a 
collection of Trump’s cruelties, collusions, corruptions, and crimes, and it felt urgent 
to track them, to ensure these horrors—happening almost daily—would not be forgotten. 
Now that Trump has returned to office, amid civil rights, humanitarian, economic, and 
constitutional crises, we felt it critical to make an inventory of this new round of 
horrors. This list will be updated monthly between now and the end of Donald Trump’s 
second term.

JANUARY 2025
– January 20, 2025 – During his inaugural address at the Capitol Rotunda, Donald Trump 
proclaimed, “The golden age of America begins right now… From this day forward, our 
country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.” During the speech, he 
condemned the Biden administration while President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris 
sat directly behind him. Trump stated he would reverse “horrible betrayals” and railed 
against a “radical and corrupt establishment” that he said “extracted power and wealth 
from our citizens.” On the dais near him sat a few of the wealthiest citizens in the 
world, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

– January 20, 2025 – Trump offered unconditional pardons to approximately 1,500 people 
charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. “These are 
people who actually love our country,” Trump announced, “so we thought a pardon would 
be appropriate.” Several January 6 defendants refused to accept their pardons. Mary 
Hemphill, often referred to as “MAGA Granny,” said, “It’s an insult to the Capitol 
police officers, to the rule of law, and to the nation. It contributes to their false 
propaganda—that they continue to gaslight the nation and everyone that it was a 
peaceful protest.”

– January 20, 2025 – In violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship. Attorneys general from twenty-two states sued in federal court. US District Judge John Coughenour blocked the order, describing it as “blatantly unconstitutional.” “We’re the only country in the world that does [birthright citizenship],” Trump said. Dozens of countries, including Canada, Mexico, and many South American nations, offer birthright citizenship.

– January 20, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. He described it as “a rip-off.” During his inaugural address, Trump said, “We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.” Fossil fuel interests gave Trump’s presidential campaign an estimated $75 million. Newly appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright founded the fracking firm Liberty Energy. In 2023, Wright claimed, “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.”

– January 20, 2025 – Trump signed Executive Order 14169, which mandated a ninety-day 
pause on all US foreign development assistance programs. The order, entitled 
“Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” stated, “The United States 
foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many 
cases antithetical to American values.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “There will 
be changes, but the changes are not meant to be destructive, they’re not meant to be 
punitive.” Abby Maxam, head of Oxfam America, stated that suspending funding “could 
have life or death consequences” for children and families around the world.

– January 20, 2025 – During a speech at an inauguration celebration, Elon Musk, Trump’s 
pick to lead his Department of Governmental Efficiency, gave not one but two fascists 
gestures. “I just want to say thank you for making [Trump’s election victory] happen,” 
the billionaire told supporters. He then pounded his chest and extended his arm 
diagonally in the air, very similar to the Nazi Party’s infamous salute. After the 
crowd cheered, he did it a second time. In recent months, Musk had been increasingly 
engaging with far-right groups, like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland. Trump, 
too, has been criticized for his fascist views, even by his vice president, JD Vance, 
who once called him “America’s Hitler.”

– January 21, 2025 – Trump introduced Executive Order 14151, aimed at ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) policies throughout the federal government. The order stated, “Federal employment practices, and employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.” Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the government already hires and promotes exclusively based on merit: “The results are clear: a diverse federal workforce that looks like the nation it serves. We should all be proud of that.”

– January 23, 2025 – Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general in a late-night purge of independent government watchdog officials assigned to investigate crime and abuse. The fired inspectors general received White House emails that stated, “Due to changing priorities, your position as Inspector General… is terminated, effective immediately.” In response to the firings, Trump said, “Some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing the job.” He claimed that the mass removal of inspectors general was “a very standard thing to do.” The terminations directly violated a federal law that required a thirty-day notice to Congress that included a rationale for the firings.

– January 24, 2025 – Just hours before he visited areas devastated by the Southern 
California wildfires, Trump blamed California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and 
other state officials for the fires. “Look, Gavin’s got one thing he can do,” Trump 
told Fox News. “He can release the water that comes from the north. There is massive 
amounts of water, rainwater, and mountain water that comes, too, with the snow, comes 
down as it melts, there’s so much water.” Water resource and environmental engineering 
experts said there was no connection between California’s water supply and the deadly 
wildfires.

– January 24, 2025 – Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, 
was narrowly confirmed after allegations of his past sexual violence, alcoholism, 
workplace misconduct, and affinity for far-right and neo-Nazi groups came to light. An 
affidavit by Hegseth’s former sister-in-law alleged that Hegseth, who has a white-
extremist symbol tattooed on his chest, regularly made racist comments to his ex-wife 
while drunk. Upon his confirmation, Trump said, “We have a great secretary of defense, 
and we’re very happy,” adding, “the important thing is winning.”

– January 25, 2025 – In Chicago, Secret Service agents showed up at Hamline Elementary 
School and attempted to question an eleven-year-old who had posted an anti-Trump video 
online. The agents first visited a residence in the neighborhood to investigate a “threat 
to one of our protectees in reference to the recent TikTok ban.” They then visited the 
school and showed identification to school administrators, who refused to let them in. 
Initially, school officials falsely stated that the agents were from ICE, reflecting the 
community’s growing fears amid heightened tensions over immigration policy. More than 90 
percent of Hamline’s students are Latinx and about two-thirds are English-language learners.

– January 25, 2025 – During a phone call with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Trump said he 
wanted Jordan to welcome more Palestinians from Gaza. “I’d love for you to take on more 
because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess. You’re talking 
about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.” Jordanian 
Foreign Affairs Minister Ayman Safadi promptly replied, “Our refusal of displacement 
is a steadfast position that will not change.” In response to Trump’s suggestion, 
Senator Lindsey Graham said, “I don’t know what he’s talking about.”

– January 25, 2025 – At a Las Vegas rally, Trump speculated about running for additional presidential terms. “It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once but twice—or three or four times.” Just two days later, in a speech to House Republicans at Mar-a-Lago, Trump added, “I’ve raised a lot of money for the next race that I assume I can’t use for myself, but I’m not 100 percent sure,” eliciting laughter from House Speaker Mike Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer. The Twenty-Second Amendment to the US Constitution explicitly bans a president from being elected to more than two terms.

– January 27, 2025 – President Trump signed executive orders banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, eliminating the military’s diversity programs, and reinstating with back pay service members who were previously discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations. The order banning trans service members stated that “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle” and “is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.” In 2018, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps chiefs all told Congress that transgender troops did not negatively impact unit cohesion, discipline issues, or morale.

– January 27, 2025 – In an internal memo sent to federal agencies, the White House ordered a temporary pause on federal grant and loan disbursements to ensure compliance with Trump’s recent executive orders. “The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars,” wrote Matthew J. Vaeth, then acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. A spreadsheet identified 2,600 federal programs under review, showing impacts to foreign aid, homeless shelters, food stamps, college financial aid, disaster reconstruction, Social Security, and senior health care.

– January 27, 2025 – Trump signed an executive order aimed at restricting gender-affirming 
health care—such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery—for those under the age 
of nineteen. “Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing 
a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults 
can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,” the 
order stated. “This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation’s history, and it must 
end.” In temporarily blocking the executive order, US District Judge Brendan A. Hurson 
said, “This is a population with an extremely higher rate for suicide, poverty, 
unemployment, drug addiction. [Abruptly stopping health care would be] horribly dangerous 
for anyone, for any care, but especially for this extremely vulnerable population.” 
Research shows that gender-diverse minors face increased risks for mental health 
issues, substance use, and suicide, and that gender-affirming health care improves 
overall well-being and quality of life.

– January 28, 2025 – In her first White House briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Elon Musk–led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had prevented a planned $50 million from going “out the door to fund condoms in Gaza,” a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Musk later reposted a video of Leavitt’s remarks with the comment “tip of the iceberg.” Leavitt’s claim was subsequently repeated and expanded upon by the president: “We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas. They used them as a method of making bombs. How about that?” No evidence was offered to support Leavitt’s, Musk’s, or Trump’s claims. A federal report published in 2024 and now inaccessible on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) website showed that the agency’s total worldwide spending on condoms in 2023 was only $7.1 million and that no condoms were provided or funded for the Middle East between 2021 and 2023.

– January 28, 2025 – The day after a passenger plane and Army helicopter collided mid-air 
above the Potomac River in Washington, DC, Trump blamed the deadly crash on DEI. At the 
time of Trump’s statement, an investigation into the cause of the crash was still ongoing. 
Trump stated, without evidence, that a “diversity push” by the Federal Aviation 
Administration had resulted in “hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric 
disabilities.” “We have to have the smartest people,” said Trump, referring to air 
traffic controllers. “It doesn’t matter what they look like, how they speak, who they 
are.” When a reporter asked Trump directly whether he believed “this crash was somehow 
caused as the result of diversity hiring,” Trump responded, “It just could have been.” 
Sixty-seven people were killed in the collision, the first major US commercial 
passenger crash since 2009.

– January 30, 2025 – During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 
Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, doubled down on past 
statements that Black people have stronger immune systems than white people and should 
receive vaccines on a different schedule. In response to questions from Senator Angela 
Alsobrooks, who is Black, Kennedy said that a “series of studies” by the Mayo Clinic 
have shown that “to particular antigens Blacks have a much stronger reaction.” Dr. 
Richard Kennedy (no relation), a vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic whom Robert F. 
Kennedy cited during the hearing, said the health secretary nominee was “twisting the 
data far beyond what they actually demonstrate.” Studies show that false beliefs about 
biological differences between Black and white people are associated with racial 
disparities in medical assessment and treatment.

– January 30, 2025 – The mass deportation operation spearheaded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE ) rattled immigrant communities across the country. A recent announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that DHS officials would enter schools and churches to conduct raids. The deportation operation was meant to remove dangerous criminals. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, admitted to “collateral arrests.” The Trump administration said it had arrested 7,400 people in nine days, and White House and ICE officials highlighted several dozen arrested immigrants on social media. No information in the thousands of other cases was made available.

– January 31, 2025 – The Justice Department fired dozens of prosecutors and demanded a 
list of FBI employees who had worked on investigations related to the January 6, 2021, 
attack on the US Capitol. Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, characterized 
the initial hiring of these prosecutors during the Biden presidency as “subversive” and 
concurred with Trump’s description of the Capitol attack investigations as “a grave 
national injustice.” At the time of the Capitol attacks, Bove worked for the US Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York and directed prosecutors to support the FBI’s 
investigations. “At no point did I ever hear him or anybody else express concern about 
these investigations and these arrests that we were making,” said Christopher O’Leary, 
an FBI counterterrorism official who worked with Bove on the investigations.

– January 31, 2025 – In compliance with Trump’s executive orders eliminating federal DEI 
programs and requiring the government to recognize only two sexes, numerous Department of 
Health and Human Services webpages and datasets were taken down, including CDC and NIH 
pages related to HIV, LGBTQ+ health, STI treatment, and food safety during pregnancy. In 
response, the Infectious Disease Society of America released a statement, noting that 
the removal of these online resources was “deeply concerning” and created “a dangerous 
gap in scientific information and data to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks.”
