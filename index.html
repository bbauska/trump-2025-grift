    performed as president since January 16, 2025 to August 1st, 2025. So bloody embarrassing to

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Top 20 Trump Grifts January to August 1, 2025</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>BitCoin<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Top Trump Meme Coin Holders Get Private Dinner, White House Tour
              President Trump is inviting the top 220 holders of his $TRUMP memecoin to join him for a private 
              dinner, followed by a tour of the White House.
              The announcement sent the token’s price up more than 60%.</p>
              <p>Trump, through his affiliated entities, retains ownership in about 80% of the total supply of 
              Trump tokens and collects fees on each trade. The coin has already generated hundreds of millions’ 
              worth of profits for entities affiliated with the president.<br>
              Just last week, they earned $1.3 million in fees. - Scott Galloway</p>
			</li>
            <li>Selling access to the White House<br>
              <p>Trump appears to be openly selling access to the White House in exchange for cash that 
              goes not to campaign accounts but more or less directly into Trump’s pocket.
              Nearly 80 percent of $TRUMP, a digital “collectible” that has no intrinsic value, is 
              owned by the Trump Organization and its affiliates and currently trades at a price that 
              makes it worth around $2.7 billion. - NY Mag.</p>
			</li>
            <li>Insider trading<br>
              <p>Donald Trump’s firm earned $415 million in a single day, while White House employees made 
              billions. Trump is facing fresh scrutiny after urging people to ”buy’ amid the recent stock 
              market crash — hours before he announced a pause on sweeping reciprocal tariffs.
              Democrats have since issued calls for an insider trading investigation with many noting that 
              one of his two posts had also included the ticker symbol for his own company.
              A video of Trump joking about how associates had made hundreds of millions of dollars. 
              also gone viral in the ensuing hours.<br>
              <a href="youtu.be/g04btWWtcDE">YouTube</a><br>
              <p>“He made 2.5 million today and he made $900 million. That’s not bad,” the POTUS 
			  can be heard saying amid laughter in the widely circulated clip.</p>
              <p>His own 53% ownership stake in Trump Media — now in a trust controlled by his oldest son Donald 
              Trump Jr — rose by $415 million on the day.</p>
              <p>Trump Media was bested, albeit by only two-hundreds of a percentage point, by another Trump 
              administration stock pick — Elon Musk’s Tesla. - Financial Express</p>
			</li>
            <li>Private club sells access<br>
              $500,000 membership fee</p>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">A new private membership club called Executive Branch has been launched in Washington, D.C., 
              targeting the ultra-wealthy and aligned with former President Donald Trump.</p>
              <p>The club was created by Omeed Malik, David Sacks, Donald Trump Jr., Chris Buskirk, Zach Witkoff, 
              and Alex Witkoff. Membership costs over $500,000, which is reported to be about 50 times the cost 
              of other non-country clubs in the city.</p>
              <p>The high membership fee has sparked speculation that the club may be designed to attract lobbyists 
              or provide exclusive facilities unmatched by existing clubs in the capital. - Daily Kos</p>
            </li>
            <li>Sell condos to Russians<br>
              63 Russian elites and oligarchs have invested around $100 million into Trump-brand real estate.</p>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trump has insisted he doesn't have business dealings with Russia.</p>
              <p>"I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia," Trump said</p>
              <p>But that doesn't mean that Russians aren't investing in Trump. In fact, at least 63 Russian 
              elites and oligarchs have invested around $100 million into Trump-brand real estate in southern 
              Florida, a Reuters investigation revealed.</p>
              <p>In the Florida resort town of Sunny Isles Beach, an area with the highest number of Russian-born 
              residents in the U.S., the Trump brand has six residential towers.</p>
              <p>Some of the individuals investing in these towers have ties to the Russian political 
              establishment, and their identities could shed light on the complex web of business 
              dealings that connect Trump to Russia. - Newsweek</p>
			</li>
            <li>Saudi golf tournament<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trumps Grifting Off New Saudi Golf Deal While America Isn't Looking<br>
              <p>A deal between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-funded LIV league would directly benefit the US 
              president’s family business.</p>
              <p>The US president also found time to try to broker an agreement between two rival golf 
              tournaments, the US-based PGA Tour and the LIV Golf league, funded by Saudi Arabia.
              The deal would directly benefit Trump’s family business, which owns and manages golf courses 
              around the world. And it would be the latest example of Trump using the presidency to advance 
              his personal interests.</p>
              <p>Trump hosted a meeting at the White House between Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, 
              and Yasir al-Rumayyan, chair of LIV Golf and head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, 
              along with the golf star Tiger Woods.
              It was the second meeting convened by Trump at the White House this month with PGA Tour 
              officials involved in negotiating with the Saudi wealth fund. A day before his latest 
              attempt at high-level golf diplomacy, Trump travelled to Miami to speak at a conference 
              organized by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which is managed by Al-Rumayyan but ultimately 
              controlled by the kingdom’s de facto ruler and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. - The Guardian</p>
            </li>
            <li>$100,000 watches<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">A “truly special” line of Trump-branded watches, including a gold, diamond-encrusted tourbillon he’s selling for $100,000.</p>
              <p>Around the same time that Melania, was noting Americans’ difficulties buying household 
              necessities.- Rolling Stone</p>
            </li>
            <li>Pardons for donors<br>
              <p>Trump Pardons Jared Kushner’s Dad, Who Paid a Prostitute to Seduce His Brother-in-Law</p>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Kushner was a multimillionaire real estate executive when he was sentenced in 2005 to two years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to 18 counts, including tax evasion and 
              making illegal campaign contributions.</p>
              <p>Once Kushner discovered his brother-in-law and former business partner was assisting 
              federal authorities in their investigation, he set out for revenge (and, as prosecutors 
              would argue, witness intimidation).</p>
              <p>The wealthy New York real estate magnate hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law 
              in a New Jersey motel, arranging to have the encounter recorded with a hidden camera. - People</p>
              <p>Charles Kushner who Trump pardoned, gave $1 million to a Trump super PAC<br>
              Charles Kushner, the father of Donald Trump's son-in-law and the recipient of one of the 
              former president's final pardons, donated $1 million to Trump's leading super PAC.
              One of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes Kushner pleaded guilty in 2004 to a host of 
              federal charges, including witness tampering and tax evasion. In one of the more salacious 
              aspects of the case, Kushner hired a sex worker to lure his brother-in-law and then sent a 
              video of their encounter to his sister. Chris Christie, who oversaw the case, called it "one 
              of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes," that he'd ever prosecuted. - Business Insider</p>
            </li>
            <li>Dinner at White House<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trump offers private dinner to the top investors in his meme 
			  coin Trump’s meme coin soared after a website promoting it announced that some holders 
			  of the coin would receive an invitation to a private dinner with Trump – in a stark 
			  illustration of his family’s drive to profit off cryptocurrency while he serves in the 
			  White House.</p>
              <p>Trump family’s drive to profit off cryptocurrency<br>
              The official website of $TRUMP coin promised an “unforgettable Gala DINNER with the 
			  President” on May 22 at his members-only club outside Washington to the top 220 holders 
			  of the meme coin. The top 25 holders are promised additional perks: an “exclusive 
			  reception” with Trump before the dinner and a “Special VIP Tour” the following day.</p>
              <p>Special VIP White House Tour<br>
              An earlier version of the site, archived Wednesday by the Wayback Machine, called it a 
              “Special VIP White House Tour.”</p>
              <p>The offer is the latest move by Trump and his relatives in the crypto business.</p>
              <p>Trump and his wife each launched meme coins on the eve of his inauguration.
              Other ventures include a crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial.
              The Trump administration has taken a pro-crypto stance, easing up on Biden-era regulation of 
              the industry and establishing a bitcoin reserve.
              As news of the dinner offer spread, the $TRUMP coin’s value soared by more than 50%, according 
              to CoinMarketCap. - CNN</p>
            </li>
            <li>Over-priced documentary<br>
              <p>$40 Million Melania Trump Film<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">James Carville said he’s stunned that Amazon is spending 
			    $40 million to license a documentary on Melania Trump but suggested that the sum 
				is merely a poorly veiled gift from founder Jeff Bezos to President-elect Donald 
				Trump and his wife.</p>
              <p>Happening right in front of you<br>
			    “What’s happening right in front of your fucking eyes, right there, they’re paying 
				her $40 million,” said Carville in a video for Politicon.<br>
				“I don’t know; somebody better look into this. They could make a documentary 
				on the history of the universe and not spend $40 million.” - HuffPost</p>
              <p>Trump family has profited from their White House<br>
			    The first lady’s share of the $40 million is more than 70 percent, the outlet 
				reported. The First Lady’s agent has also been trying to sell sponsorships 
				for the film, starting at $10 million, without Amazon being aware.</p>
              <p>The deal with Amazon is one way of many that the Trump family has profited from 
			    their White House return. - The Independent</p>
            </li>
            <li>Scam over Truth Social<br>
              "Truth Social could be a front for a campaign finance scam - Mary Trump<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Mary Trump, the outspoken niece and frequent critic of 
			    former president Donald Trump, has offered her views on Truth Social, the social 
				media venture spearheaded by her uncle, saying it could be a potential multi-
				billion-dollar campaign funding scam.</p>
              <p>She thinks Truth Social might be operating as a clandestine operation to raise 
			    campaign funds, skirting federal regulations and potentially welcoming unsanctioned 
				foreign influence.</p>
              <p>"Direct donations to political candidates are subject to FEC laws, which impose 
			    limits on the amount that can be donated and require transparency about the source 
				of donations," she said. "Now that Truth Social is a publicly traded company, 
				however, supporters and even foreign entities have a new, surreptitious way to 
				back Donald financially without having to make a direct political donation."</p>
              <p>Mary Trump is warning that the social platform's public listing in March inflated 
			    its financial valuation without a solid foundation, paving the way for potential 
				campaign finance irregularities.</p>
             <p>By allowing supporters—and possibly the foreign entities she mentioned—to purchase 
			   stock, Mary Trump said the funds can indirectly be funneled to Donald Trump's 
			   coffers, bypassing the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) stringent donation 
			   caps and transparency mandates. - Newsweek</p>
            </li>
            <li>Over-priced guitar<br>
              Trump Guitars<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">The day before Christmas eve, Trump posted a link for 
			   supporters to buy a Les Paul-style six-string from “Trump Guitars,” weeks after 
			   legendary guitar manufacturer Gibson hit the website with a cease-and-desist 
			   order. - Rolling Stone</p>
              <p>In case you were wondering if Donald Trump would run out of things to license 
			    his name on, have no fear. Today he announced that he is officially endorsing 
				guitars, both acoustic and electric. - Rolling Stone</p>
            </li>
            <li>Land for development - Vietnam<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">The Trump Organization and its partner in Vietnam are 
			    working on multiple investments worth billions of dollars in golf courses, 
				hotels and real estate projects in the Southeast Asian country, a spokesman 
				for the consortium told Reuters.</p>
              <p>The plans by the family business of U.S. President Donald Trump are proceeding 
			    amid risks of U.S. tariffs on Vietnam, which has one of the world's largest trade 
				surpluses with Washington and last year exported goods worth 30% of its GDP to 
				the United States. - Reuters</p>

            <li>Political donations<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Musk spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to elect Trump.<br>
                Elon Musk plowed at least $260 million into efforts to send Donald Trump back to the 
                White House, new filings show – a massive infusion that makes him one of the largest 
                single political underwriters of a presidential campaign and underscores the outsized

              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trump family and library have raked in whopping $80 
                million since White House return. Companies have spent about $80 million on 
                projects benefitting the Trump family and the Trump presidential library since 
                his return to the White House...</p>
              <p>The staggering amount shows how much financial power the Trump name brings. 
                The $80 million comes from various areas including donations and lawsuit 
                settlements. The money will add to the Trumps’ fortune and help cover costs 
                such as his presidential library.</p>
              <p>After President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump joined Amazon 
                founder Jeff Bezos for dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December, Amazon spent $40 
                million on a documentary series the first lady pitched during the dinner. It 
                was the most Amazon had ever spent on a documentary — the second-highest offer 
                came from Disney, who offered $14 million. Netflix and Apple didn’t bid on the 
                film.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson for Amazon told The Journal: “We licensed the upcoming Melania 
                Trump documentary film and series for one reason and one reason only—because we 
                think customers are going to love it.”</p>
              <p>The first lady’s share of the $40 million is more than 70 percent, the outlet 
               reported. The First Lady’s agent has also been trying to sell sponsorships for 
               the film, starting at $10 million, without Amazon being aware.</p>
              <p>The deal with Amazon is one way of many that the Trump family has profited from

              $100 coins<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trump bills Trump Coins as “a true symbol of American greatness,” 
                noting they are “minted right here in the U.S.A.” and claiming they were designed by Trump 
                himself. “Crafting American Legacy,” the Trump Coins website reads.</p>
              <p>Trump is selling the “limited edition” coins for $100 apiece, even though they’re 
                made with $30 worth of silver. It may seem like a lot until you realize they come with

              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Trump digital trading cards<br>
			  Trump began selling digital trading cards during the NFT boom, and hasn’t stopped.
			  He announced “Series 4” of the cards in a video post in late August that seems like it was 
			  filmed in an alternate universe from the one in which he is trying to win a presidential 
			  election and warning of nuclear holocaust if he loses.</p>
              <p>“It’s your favorite president with some exciting news,” Trump says in the video, 
              introducing the release of 50 new digital trading cards, back by popular demand.
              “These cards show me dancing, and even holding some Bitcoins,” the former president 
              intones, noting that if supporters buy 15 of them at $99 apiece, they’ll receive a 
              physical card containing a piece of the suit he wore during his debate against Biden 
              in June. “This is something to give your grandchildren,” he says before teasing a 
              few more special offers. “Let’s have fun together and enjoy my Trump cards. We’re 
              going to be talking about it for a long time.” - Rolling Stone</p>

              <p>He was loudly booed as he did so next to a pair of the gold shoes he is selling

              <p>$239 million<br>
              <p class="tallFirstLetter">Major corporate interests and megadonors gave $239 million 
              to fund Trump's inauguration. The massive haul is more than double the $109 million 
              raised for his first inauguration in 2017. Among those who wrote major checks were 
              people tapped by Trump to become government officials, as well as prominent 
              corporations (and their leaders) with business in front of the administration, 
              particularly those in the oil, financial, technology and transportation sectors.

              Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., a major poultry producer, donated more than any other 
              individual or company, sending $5 million to Trump's inaugural committee.
              Just behind was Ripple Labs, the cryptocurrency and blockchain company, which gave 
              almost $4.9 million. A handful of energy companies gave at least $500,000 each — 
              including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell and Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
